Newbie Guide:<br>
Are you ready for a new mission?<br>
After swapping the Weapon Exchange Ticket you received previously with the Non-Grade Shadow Weapon, go visit <font color="LEVEL">%tonpc%</font> and return after receiving quest reward.
 To find <font color="LEVEL">%tonpc%</font>, follow the <font color="LEVEL">arrow</font> above your head. I will tell you more later.<br>
Can I help you with anything else?<br>
