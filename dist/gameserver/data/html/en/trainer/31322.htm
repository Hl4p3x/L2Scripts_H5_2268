Master Erian:<br>
You adventurers are all the same! You think that, because you can swing a sword without chopping your fingers off, you're all mighty heroes! The truth is that your movements are wild and inefficient. Your tactical sense is nonexistent. You're easily distracted by anything that glitters.<br>
Study with me and I'll make a real soldier out of you! I'll make you disciplined and hard as brass! Hooyah!<br>
