Sorceress Juria:<br>
The source of war is the Green Dragon, Antharas ... 
It is one of the six dragons derived from Shilen 
that embody the characteristics of the earth.<br>
It lies in the deepest part of the the Dragon Valley, 
fast asleep, but we don't know when it will wake and 
cause great havok. When that happens, this village 
will be reduced to ashes in the blink of an eye.<br>
