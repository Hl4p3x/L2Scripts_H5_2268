Magister Yunha:<br>
Are you anxious to learn about this Hills of Gold is? I cannot say how old it is, but this is certainly the site where the heroes of old rescued our people from evil invaders. It is said that one of the heroes used a magical golden shield to thwart the enemy and help secure victory. Because of this legend, so many visitors now come here that the place itself is in danger of becoming polluted. Will you tell me why you're here?<br>
