Master Noir:<br>
Welcome. I am Master Noir of the Kamael Guild here. As you may know, Giran is a center of trade and the Traders Guild has need of exceptional warriors.<br>
The Fighters Guild believes they can provide those, but their pride will be their downfall. Our Kamael Guild will easily produce more skilled and battle-ready warriors than they could ever hope to do.<br>
