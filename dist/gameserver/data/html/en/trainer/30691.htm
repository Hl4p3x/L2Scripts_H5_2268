Master Aren Atebalt:<br>
Hey, let's be friends. I am Aren. Do you like the village? The scenery is nice and the people are friendly... No one's a real nuisance.<br>
I didn't used to think that this village was dangerous, but I'm not so naive anymore... If you're planning on staying for a while, you might want to grow eyes in the back of your head, ha ha.<br>
