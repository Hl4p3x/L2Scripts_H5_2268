Blacksmith Bronp:<br>
Always happy to boast about our guild!<br>
While the other races were still throwing bamboo spears and swinging stone axes, our ancestors had mastered bronze tools and begun crafting steel weapons. Only the best craftsmen are allowed entry into the Black Anvil Guild. We, in turn, have fashioned mithril weapons and adamantite armor worn by kings and princes.<br>
But beyond that, we have been researching the ancient devices of the Giants. Our fearsome Siege Golems and revoluntionary airships are the results of those studies. Astounding, isn't it?<br>
