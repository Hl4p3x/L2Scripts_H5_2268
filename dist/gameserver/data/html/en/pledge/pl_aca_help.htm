  <body>Any Level 5 or higher clan may found an Academy.
    <br> Anyone below Level 40 who hasn't made the second class transfer may join the Academy. Once they make the second class transfer (even after joining), that member is automatically withdrawn from the Academy.
    <br> Up to 20 people can be members of an Academy at one time. The individual level of the clan member at the time of their joining determines the number of clan reputation points awarded to the clan upon that member's graduation.
    <br> A D-Grade armor acquisition quest is available exclusively for Academy members. At graduation, members also receive an Academy Circlet as a reward.
    <br>An existing clan member can be appointed as an Academy member's sponsor. Sponsors can view whether the academy member is logged in, as well as assist the member during the armor acquisition quest.
    <br> Academy members may wear the D-Grade armor only while still a member.
