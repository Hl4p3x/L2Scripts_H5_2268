  <body>One of the Clan members can be selected and be delegated the role of Clan Leader.
    <br>If you request delegation of a Clan Leader, it is usually completed every Tuesday.  However, sometimes the delegation process can be completed sooner than that.  Please consider your decision carefully before making the request.
    <br>Once the delegation process is completed it cannot be canceled.  However, it is possible to cancel it if the process has not been completed.
    <br>I'll say this once more. Since the delegation of a Clan Lord is the process in which all the rights of a Clan Leader are transferred to another Clan member, you need to consider your decision very carefully before submitting your request.
