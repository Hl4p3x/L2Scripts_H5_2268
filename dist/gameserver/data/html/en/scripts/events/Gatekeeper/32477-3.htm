Well, aren't you kind...<br>
Your encouragement and support gives us even more strength.<br>
As a token of our gratitude, we will allow you to change your appearance to look like us. I should warn you though: unlike using a Gatekeeper Transformation Stick, you won't be able to display any real power with this regular appearance change.<br>
