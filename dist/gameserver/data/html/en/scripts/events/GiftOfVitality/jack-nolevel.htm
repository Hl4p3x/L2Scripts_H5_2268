You are not qualified to receive the Memories of a Newbie. Can you see a newbie guide or adventurer guide next to me? Please receive the Newbie Support buffs from them. The Memories of a Newbie has the same effect as the Newbie Support buffs which you're receiving.<br>
(Only characters level 76 or more can receive the Memories of a Newbie.)<br>
