You've done it again! Nine straight losses! I can't keep this up or something terrible will happen! Oh, well, the odds are against you now for sure! If you quit now, I'll give you two Scrolls: Enchant Armor (Grade S).<br1>
..... Or, if you win just one more time, I'll give you a Scroll: Enchant Weapon (Grade S). Do you want to try for that?<br1>
