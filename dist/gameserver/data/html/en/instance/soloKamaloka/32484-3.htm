Pathfinder Worker:<br>
To begin, I'll tell you about the enemies. <font color="LEVEL">Kanabion</font> - not just a monster, a creature that appeared as a result of the connection of evil and darkness.<br>
Our goal - to destroy them and prevent the location Kamaloka in Aden.<br>
If you kill enough Kanabions, then we'll give you some ammunition. In time we'll assign you a grade <font color="LEVEL">from D to S</font>, depending on your results.<br>
Or we can return collected by you with Kanabions <font color="LEVEL">Essence of Kamaloka</font>. But in the real world there are no places where they can use.<br>
Give them to us, if you think that you do not need. We offer appropriate compensation.<br>
And if you die Rim Kamaloka, nobody can help you before time runs out or of stay until the moment when all will be defeated. It's your dream.<br>
So our technology will allow you to be Rim Kamaloka within <font color="LEVEL">20 minutes</font>. Do not forget about it.
