<br>You wish to remove the refined Life Stone? That's fine. But understand that this smelting method offers both improvement and potential penalties.<br>
It is difficult to restore the original weapon when removing the Life Stone. It requires a special chemical process and a special tool. It's also expensive.<br>
With that in mind, would you still like to remove the Life Stone from the refined weapon?<br>
