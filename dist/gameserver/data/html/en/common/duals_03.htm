<br>Ah! You wish to have a Dualsword made? That is our specialty! In fact, we can make every type of Dualsword except the A-grade!<br>
If there's anyone better than us, it could only be the legendary <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith of Mammon</font>! <br>
You don't have to bring me a stamp, either. <br>
Just bring me the swords you want combined as well as Stones of Purity as a fee.<br>
Make sure the swords are either Regular, Standard or Rare.<br>
Regular weapons must be combined with other Regular weapons, Standard weapons must be combined with other Standard weapons, and Rare weapons must be combined with other Rare weapons. A Rare Dualsword can only be made using swords above grade B, which is the lowest grade we work with.<br>
Remember that if you invest some kind of a skill in a weapon, you can't combine it with another.<br>
Remember as well that an Enchanted weapon loses its effect once it is combined with another.<br>
Which Dualsword would you like? Select one now.<br>
