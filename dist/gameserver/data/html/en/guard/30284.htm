Sentinel Knight Smallberry:<br>
May the divine protection of Eva be with you. I am Sentinel Knight Smallberry, commander of the*Sentinels* that guard the holy forest and the Mother Tree Glade.<br>
The building you see behind me is the*Sanctuary of Eva* -- the elders that guide the Elves of Light dwell here. It is also a place for young Elves to train in swordsmanship and magic.<br>
