Sentry Nelsya:<br>
Pleased to meet you. I am Sentry Nelsya, in charge of this village's public order. This cave leads to the Dark Elven village located within the large mountain before you. We came here a long time ago, due to pressure from other races, and built this place with our blood and tears.<br>
