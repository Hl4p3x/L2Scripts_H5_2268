Marksman Maddy:<br>
Once you leave the village, the only person who can guarantee your safety is you.<br>
The main threat is monsters, but there are also some adventurers out there that may attack you.<br>
If you choose to fight a monster, well, that's your choice and I wish you well. But if you are being chased by a murderer, I don't think there's any shame in you trying to flee back to the safety of the village.<br>
