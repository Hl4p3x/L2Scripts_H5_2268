Defender Nathan:<br>
When I look at the Spine Mountains covered with snow... I think how small we Dwarves are compared to the greatness of nature. Look at the mountains covered with snow... Don't you think wealth and fame are all meaningless?<br>
Oh, I didn't introduce myself to you. I am Defender Nathan. I am one of the members of the Defenders who guard the town despite the cold weather!<br>
