Guard Tavillian:<br>
Greetings! Welcome to the Ivory Tower!<br>
Hmm... Traveler, did you cross the northern border? What's it like there? One of my friends who works at the checkpoint said the area is in a state of emergency. He can't even go out freely...<br>
I'm worried that something bad will happen so soon after our war with Elmore. My little sister is lives in that region... Damn it! I wish she wasn't so far away!<br>
