Shh! Please be still. Over there is the <font color="LEVEL">old town</font>, which is the only entrance to the Steel Citadel. It is used as a prison camp for Native captives.<br>
Some time ago, when the Steel Citadel's defenses were temporarily weakened, we attacked the town in an attempt to rescue the captives. However, the enemy was still too strong, and many of us were killed or wounded.<br>
And our comrades in the town still thirst for their freedom!<br>
