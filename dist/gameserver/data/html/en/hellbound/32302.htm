Welcome! I have waited so long for you to come here. I must tell you that there is a strong magic barrier on the Tower of Infinitum. If someone who is not a devil enters the tower, this magic will be activated and break everything into pieces, The only way to avaoid it is to disguise yourself as a devil.<br>
To do so, you must kill a devil and cover your body with its blood...<br>
