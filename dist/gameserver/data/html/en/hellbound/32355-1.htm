Our primary target is to free <font color="LEVEL">Quarry slaves</font> from the hellbound quarry. Caravan members are being enslaved and tortured. If we want Caravan to be our friends we should help them out now.<br>
You should talk to <font color="LEVEL">Jude</font> at Caravan Encapement, he will give you last instructions.
