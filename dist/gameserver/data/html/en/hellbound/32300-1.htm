Bernarde:<br>
I want to ask you for a favor. Do you know that my ancestors in the Old Temple Ruins have been disturbed? This is tragedy...<br>
But you can give them peace by sprinkling the <font color="LEVEL">Holy Water</font>. Here, take this bottle, it should be enough to calm their souls.<br>
Pay me 5 Darion's Badges for the bottle to know that you're one of us.<br>
