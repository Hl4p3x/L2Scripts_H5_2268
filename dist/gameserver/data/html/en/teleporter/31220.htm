Event Gatekeeper:<br>
Who seeks the Throne of Chaos at the dawn of this new era?<br>
Well, I thought I'd try a more dramatic greeting once, just for kicks. I did hear a rumor about a new era, you know.<br>
Anyway, I'm the event gatekeeper. I appear for the teleport event every time there's a new update!<br>
During the teleport event period, I can teleport you to the nearby hunting ground at a much cheaper fee than normal!<br>
Come see me often during the event period!<br>
