Separated Soul:<br>
The Claw of Antharas barely touched my face, but my soul was still ripped apart like this.<br>
I can't gather the scattered souls in the area, but I can sense them. I could send you to the location of the souls, but you don't look capable yet of combining my ripped soul.<br>
(Moving to the location of the other separated souls requires the character to be at <font color="LEVEL">level 80 or above</font>.)
