Gatekeeper Roxxy:<br>
The Airship Field is where Airships heading to and from <font color="LEVEL">Gracia</font> dock. A powerful magic force field prevents entry to Gracia from sea or via teleportation.<br>
But Gracian-made Airships can travel safely through the force field. It is still a dangerous journey, though!<br>
After several years of work, a wharf was constructed from magical stones capable of floating in mid-air. You can board one of the Airships using an <font color="LEVEL">Airship Controller</font>.<br>
If you wish to visit Gracia, this is the only way. I can teleport you to the wharf if you wish.<br>
