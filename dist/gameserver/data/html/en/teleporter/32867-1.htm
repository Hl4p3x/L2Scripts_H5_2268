Separated Soul:<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">Will of Antharas</font> is a command stone that Anthatas embedded into his high commanding minions. With this stone Antharas has the ability to control these creatures to do his bidding. It is a required ingredient for creating an Antharas Blood Crystal.<br>
A long time ago when Antharas's blood was split on the ground the poison in the blood corrupted the land. However, over time land acted as a filter seperating the poison from the blood. The result was a pure form of Antharas blood that crystallized over time into small <font color="LEVEL">Sealed Blood Crystals</font>. The power in Antharas's blood has a high concentration power. Enough that it even has the power to bring back the dead. It is a required ingredient for creating an Antharas Blood Crystal.
