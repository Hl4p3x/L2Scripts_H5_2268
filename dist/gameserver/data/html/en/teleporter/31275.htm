Gatekeeper Tatiana:<br>
Greetings. I am Tatiana, Gatekeeper of Goddard Castle Town. If you wish, I can open the door of space and time and enable you to move vast distances in a flash. To fully understand the process, you would need years of training at the Ivory Tower, just as I have done.<br>
Well! Have you decided on a destination?<br>
