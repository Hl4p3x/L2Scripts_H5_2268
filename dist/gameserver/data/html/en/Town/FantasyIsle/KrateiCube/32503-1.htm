Kratei's Cube Entrance Manager:<br>
Kratei's Cube allows <font color="LEVEL">25 warriors who are level 70 and above to compete for 20 minutes</font> to see who is the strongest.<br>
Warriors advance through the rooms of the Cube, encountering hordes of monsters as they go.<br>
Defeat as many monsters and other warriors as possible within the time limit; whoever defeats the most wins.<br>
If you are killed, you will be teleported back to the Match Manager after 10 secunds.<br>
If the match hasn't ended, you may re-enter.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Doing so will not decrease your experience score.</font><br>
The 20-minute competitions start exactly on each hour and half-hour, and you can normally register up until 3 minutes before they begin.<br>
(If there was no competition in the previous time slot, you can only register between 20-27 minutes after the hour or 50-57 minutes after the hour.)<br>
Registration and admission are impossible in the 3 minutes immediately before a competition begins.<br>
