Due to changes that were made in this update, there are some quests that <font color="LEVEL">|can no longer be completed by normal means</font>. That's what I'm here for! If you have Power of Darkness, Whisper of Dreams - Pt 1 or Whisper of Dreams - Pt 2, then I can help you finish them. But remember, I can only help with quests that were acquired prior to this update.<br>
I'm ready when you are! Just say the word!<br>
