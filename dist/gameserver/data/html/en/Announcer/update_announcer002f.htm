Something terrible has happened in the Ice Queen's Castle. We are sending word across the land that only adventurers who are <font color="LEVEL">|level 82 or above</font> enter this area.<br>
A sad and terrible tale of what happened. The great and proud Princess Felicia was a prodigy of magic in the Ivory Tower, but her pursuit of greatness caused her to study the dark arts. This came at a price which turned her into the Ice Queen Freya. What happened exactly?<br>
This is what the Jinia Guild is trying to figure out. They working on a plan to end Freya's reign of evil. The Jinia Guild knew Freya when she was once Felicia. They need to stop her before her power grows any further.<br>
A word of caution, though... the ones before you who went to stop Freya were turned to ice. Those were the lucky ones. You don't want to know what happens to those who are not turned to ice.<br>
