A Wyvern can be formed from a <font color="LEVEL">Strider of at least level 55</font> by using <font color="LEVEL">25 Crystals: B Grade</font>. Only you, my lord, are worthy to ride a Wyvern.<br>
However, if the Revolutionaries of Dusk are in possession of the Seal of Strife, you won't be able to ride a Wyvern.<br>
