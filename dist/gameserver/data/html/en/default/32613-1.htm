Game Manager Handy:<br>
Handy's block checker is a game where the team <font color="LEVEL">who checks the most blocks in the arena within the 5-minute time limit wins.</font><br>
When you enter the game, you automatically change into the <font color="LEVEL">Block Checker</font>'s shape! If you hit the blocks with the block checker's hammer...<br>
Boom! The blocks' colors change! The team with the most checked blocks -- blocks whose color has been changed -- wins!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">When the game begins, all current supplemental magic will be automatically removed! No new supplement magic can be cast, even if the game ends.</font><br>
