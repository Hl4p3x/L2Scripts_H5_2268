Gracian Survivor:<br>
Do you know the continent of Gracia? It is located far across the sea from Aden, it is the barren land with the rough climate... It was the home of a strong, hardy people.<br>
But now all has changed... Strange Seads appeared thoughout the continent, spawning Pagan Mosters who wreaked havok on the land. Although we fought under the command of King Keucereus, we were outmatched. Gracia fell under the sway of that great evil.<br>
Fortunately, a few survivors were able to reach Aden and ask for help. There your clan leaders promised to sent assistance. Since then, our soldiers have formed a combined force under the command of King Keucereus, waiting for our chance to exact vengeance on those who destroyed our homes. A few of my comrades stayed behind in Aden to appeal to other adventurers for help.<br>
