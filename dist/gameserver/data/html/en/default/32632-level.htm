Gracian Survivor:<br>
I understand your dissatisfaction, but Gracia is't an easy place. I'm sorry, but you have not enough abilities to get into Gracia. You'll become an easy target for our enemies.<br>
There are many monsters in Aden too. First you must get the experience there, and then go into Gracia.<br>
(Only characters above level 75 can get into Gracia.)
