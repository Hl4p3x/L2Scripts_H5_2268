Soldier Plenos:<br>
Welcome to Keucereus Alliance Base. We need all the soldiers we can get.<br>
Your missions here will be mainly in the sky. My advice is to obtain an Airship, but I see some adventurers from Aden also fight using their ability of transformation.<br>
Go ask Engineer Lekon about which method is best for you. If you want to know about our enemy, talk to Admiral Keucereus or General Dilios.<br>
