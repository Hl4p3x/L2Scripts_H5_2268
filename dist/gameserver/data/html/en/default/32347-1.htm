Shadai:<br>
The Ancient Text ot the Demon is an old tome regarded as an unholy scriptures by the Demons of Hellbound. It was created through the power of darkness and contains a mysterious energy, which can be very useful -- if you can obtain it, of course.<br>
You can find the Hidded First Page, the Hidden Second Page and the Fragment of a Contact with the Demon by reading this book. However, it will turn to dust if you try to use phisical strength on it, so you must be careful.<br>
If you bring it to me, I can put it to good use -- it will be utterly useless to you, in case you had other ideas. But give it to me and I will exchange it for item of greather value for you.
