Guide of Immortality Jaedin:<br>
I am Jaedin, the Priest of Shilen who will guide you to the Seed of Infinity under the protection of Great Ekimus.<br>
Ah, I see you are suspicious of my intentions. You need not be, my friend -- I treat all equally. Why? Because as soon as you enter the Seed of Infinity, all roads lead to the same destination: death.<br>
Do you still wish to proceed?<br>
