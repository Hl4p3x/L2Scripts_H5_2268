Commander Kbaldir:<br>
It's been a long time since part of our fleet crashlanded into the <font color="LEVEL">Seed of Annihilation</font>.<br>
I'm told the Seed abounds with a plethora of strange organisms that might be worthy of study if they weren't so dangerous.<br>
Unfortunately that's all a null point anyway because right now, our priority is to get able bodies out there to help bring back lost soldiers and repair the fleet. I came back to Kucereus' Outpost alone to recruit those that seem strong enough to make it out in there.<br>
