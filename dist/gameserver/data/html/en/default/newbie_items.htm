Newbie Guide:<br>
As token of congratulations, the Adventure Guild is pleased to open its warehouse to both apprentice adventurers who have reached level
 6 as well as travellers who have completed their first occupation change. At level 6, you can borrow a <font color="LEVEL">No-Grade Shadow Weapon</font>
 with the <font color="LEVEL">Apprentice Adventurer's Weapon Exchange Coupon</font>. At level 20, you can borrow <font color="LEVEL">Shadow Armor</font> with the <font color="LEVEL">Adventurer's Magic Armor Exchange Coupon</font>.
 No-Grade Shadow Weapons can be exchanged up to level 19 and Shadow Armor can be exchanged up to level 39. Now then: how can I help you?<br>
(Note: chaotic characters may not use weapons or armor borrowed from Adventure Guild.)<br>
