Master Yogi:<br>
Hello child, and welcome.<br>
My name is Master Yogi, and I have come back to the lands of Aden and Elmore in possession of much knowledge and enlightenment.<br>
I have long walked the way of the ascetic and have only returned from my sojourn to share my wisdom with you.<br>
With me, I bring a new event. And through this event, you too will learn the secrets and mysteries surrounding enchantment.<br><br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Chat 1">Ask about the event.</a><br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Chat 3">Participate in the event.</a><br>
<a action="bypass -h scripts_events.MasterOfEnchanting.EnchantingReward:receive_reward">Receive reward.</a>
