Balthazar:<br>
How have you been? I go by the name of Maestro Balthazar! I'm a merchant of the Black Anvil Guild. I was a really popular blacksmith at one time but I'm not myself these days because I'm all caught up in studying golems. If you're wanting to make an item or prepare a cool two-bladed sword or something, go meet one of my blacksmith friends!<br>
