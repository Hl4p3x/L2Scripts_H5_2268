Newbie Guide:<br>
Good day, friend. I now live peacefully here on this island, but once I was a well-known adventure. Why, I ventured into the deepest part of Dragon Valley with Sir Cedric, brother of Roien.<br>
Today, my time is spent guiding novices, If you have any questions, please come and ask me. I will teach you as much as I can.<br>
