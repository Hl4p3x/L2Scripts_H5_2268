Destroyed Tumor:<br>
As soon as the reddish-brown liquid that fills the passage touches a body, it causes sharp, terrible pain.<br>
To move through this passage safely, you must use the <font color="LEVEL">Tears of Freed Soul</font>, which contain all the victims' anger against Ekimus.<br>
(An entire party must move at once. If the initiating PC possesses 1 Tears of Freed Soul, the entire party can move.)<br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_warp">Use the Tear of Freed Souls as protection and move through the passage.</a>
