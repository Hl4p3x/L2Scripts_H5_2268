Investigator Sally:<br>
It turns out the Rainbow Frog is a natural antidote for the poisons found all over the Plains of the Lizardmen. Lick or eat them and you'll recover 10% of your HP, plus they have a tangy fruit-like flavor. Just try to stay away from the poison, OK?<br>
Anything else you want to know?<br>
