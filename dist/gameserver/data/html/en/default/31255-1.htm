Pumpkins grow by drinking pumpkin nectar! After planting a seed, if you pour the nectar on the pumpkin, it will grow quickly! Meow! <br>
After drinking enough nectar, the pumpkin will become big. Then, if you hit it with a weapon, the pumpkin will crack open!<br>
But, there are several things you should be careful about!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">First of all, if you hit it before it's fully grown</font>, it will wilt from lack of nutrition. So be careful. Meow!<br>
Also, since <font color="LEVEL">a pumpkin has a tendency to run away</font>, you should try to crack it open before it gets out of hand!  Young pumpkins that are not fully grown will run off in 3 minutes and fully grown pumpkins will run away in a minute and 30 seconds! Meow!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Also, a large pumpkin can't be opened with a regular weapon!</font> Meow! I heard that there is a <font color="LEVEL">weapon called chrono something</font> that produces musical sounds when you hit it against something. Only when you use that, you will be able to crack open your pumpkin!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">One last thing! Since it's not easy to open a large pumpkin by yourself</font>, you should find a friend who can help you open it.<br>
Do you understand everything I've told you? Meow!<br>
