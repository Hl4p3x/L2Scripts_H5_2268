Buzz the Cat<br>
Meow! Nice to meet you! I'm Puss the Cat, the faithful servant of Great Magus Ahuron Raulian. <br>
My master is one of the greatest magi of the Ivory Tower.<br>
Recently, while out with his girlfriend, he helped a <font color="LEVEL">bloody pixy with an injured leg</font>.<br>
A few days later he received a box full of Pumpkin Seeds!<br>
The box was smeared with Red Fairy Dust, so it must have been sent by the grateful bloody pixy... <font color="LEVEL">But now the pumpkin grown from the seed is annoying my master, asking for nectar day and night!</font><br>
He doesn't want to offend the bloody pixy by just throwing it away, and also seems to think that something good may eventually come from it... He has asked us, his faithful servants, to give away the Pumpkin Seeds to whoever can get the nectar to raise them!<br>
We have organized a pumpkin growing event to promote his idea! Meow!  You can get nectars by killing any monsters near your level all throughout the world.<br>
