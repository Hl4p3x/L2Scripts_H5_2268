Tell me what you want, and if you are worthy I will help you.<br>
If you have already <font color="LEVEL">bestowed them with a special ability</font>, <font color="LEVEL">top-grade weapons and armor</font> can be enhanced <font color="LEVEL">beyond A-Grade</font> especially for PvP combat. Once a multi-user item is specialized, you will still be able to enchant the item. However, you cannot refine, crystallize, convert or add an attribute to it. Think carefully before making a decision...<br>
