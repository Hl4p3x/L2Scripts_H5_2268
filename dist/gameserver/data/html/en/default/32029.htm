Steward:<br>
Welcome to Ice Queen Freya's Castle. While this place used to be inhabited by Sirra, our great queen is now taking up residence here. And she has decided to open this place to all. Have a look around, if you like.<br>
If you are looking for Jinia and her guild, proceed down the road. I've heard that Jinia can get you into the Ice Queen's castle. You must let me know when you return. If you'd rather, I can teleport you there.<br>
