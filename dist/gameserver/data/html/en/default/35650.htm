Count Magician:<br>
Cast your eyes upon the results of this magicial research conducted by Mystics Guild.<br>
You can make use of a magical field capable of teleporting a clan member though a crown, as well as magic that provides special abilities to your low-ranking soldiers. We even have a Talisman, a magical crystal filled with power.<br>
We have also purchased certain items directly from the Elves' mystical merchant. How may I serve you?
