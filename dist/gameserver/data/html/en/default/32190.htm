Elder Mao:<br>
May the blessings of Nornil be with you!<br>
If you travel south from here, you can see the Nornill's Garden, home of Nornil, Mother to this Isle of Souls. My name is Mao, and I am in charge of this place. If you can overcome the ordeals of this place and meet Mother Nornil, you may be reborn as a true Kamael warrior. There will be pain, but after the pain comes joy.<br>
