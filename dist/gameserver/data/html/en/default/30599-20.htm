Newbie Guide:<br>
The protection blessing is a special protection given to <font color="LEVEL">characters under level 39 who have not made</font> the second transfer.<br>
While a character has this blessing, <font color="LEVEL">he or she cannot either inflict or recive damage when</font> in combat with a chaotic character 10 or more level higher than they are. The protection does not apply to the battle field, however.<br>
Would you like to recive the protection?<br>
