Heart of Volcano:<br>
A voice overpowers your consciousness, you fall to your knees clutching your head in agony :<br>
<font color="LEVEL">A creature born in the chaos of Creation<br1>
trapped for an eternity on earth<br1>
driven to madness<br1>
forsaken by her children.<br1>
You, Dark Pilgrim of the Holy Land,<br1>
Do you seek death at the jaws of the Fire Dragon Valakas?</font><br>
(A maximum of 200 people can challenge Valakas.)<br>
