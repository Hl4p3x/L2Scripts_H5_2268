Yiyen:<br>
Yikes! That was a surprise.<br>
...<br>
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to act so shocked â€” it's just so unusual to see people in this area...<br>
My name is Yiyen, and I'm an archeologist searching for a magical ruin that may be responsible for some strange phenomena on the Isle of Prayer. Thank the gods, I think I've finally found it.<br>
It is called the <font color="LEVEL">Dark Cloud Mansion</font>, if I have translated the name correctly...<br>
