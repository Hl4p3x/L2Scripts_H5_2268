Cybellin:
May the song of the west wind guide you to tranquility. Nice to meet you. My name is Cybellin. I am a Dark Elven Dwarf studying abyssal magic.<br>
I have come to Hunter Village to collect the rare runestones that can only be obtained in Fairy Valley. But recently, I've been really fascinated by my study of jewels called blood crystals.<br>
