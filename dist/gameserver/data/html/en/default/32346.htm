Shh! Please quieter. Behind me there is an old  town, it is the only entrance to the Steel Citadel. Now it is a camp for prisoners.<br>
Not so long ago, when the Steel Citadel temporarily weaken its defense, we attacked the town to rescue the prisoners. However, the enemies were very strong, and many of us were killed or wounded.<br>
And our friends in the town are still waiting for the liberation!<br>
