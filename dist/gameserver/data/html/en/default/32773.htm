Officer Jakan:<br>
The day that our fleet all went down in the Seed of Annihilation... I could hear the screams of my subordinates as they disappeared, but I had to leave them all behind and escape from that place with Ermian.<br>
Still, even as a soldier, I don't regret my decision. But I can't help but feel regret about the deaths of my subordinates. I can still hear their cries.<br>
I was completely helpless as my subordinates perished... This is really sad. It was all my fault...<br>
Are you also headed for the Seed of Annihilation? Then listen well. I will tell you how to survive in that hellish place...<br>
