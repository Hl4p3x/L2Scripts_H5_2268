Oracle Guide:<br>
You see a once-beautiful room made of crystal and coral, filled with jewels, and surrounded by black watery.<br>
The Crystal Caverns, where Parme is being held captive, used to be a beautiful palace. However, it has been contaminated by the Demons, and they are the only beings able to enter.<br1>
You can avoid them, however, by carrying a <font color="LEVEL">Contaminated Crystal</font>, which will make you appear to be one of them. Do not overuse it, however, or it will lose its effectiveness.<br>
Because of the danger, I cannot send you there if your abilities are not sufficient to defend yourself against the Demons, or if you are alone.<br>
(In order to enter, you must be in a party whose members are level 78 or higher. Each member must possess their own Contaminated Crystal.)<br>
