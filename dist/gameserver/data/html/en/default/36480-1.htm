If you need something, please let me know.<br>
Weapons and armor can be enhanced <font color="LEVEL">beyond Grade A</font> for <font color="LEVEL">top-grade items</font> and specialized for PvP. Weapons must have <font color="LEVEL">bestowed special abilities</font>... Once it is enhanced, an item <font color="LEVEL">can only be used by its owner</font>.<br>
And once a multi-user item is specialized, <font color="LEVEL">you can use enhanced Spellbooks, but you cannot refine, soul crystalize or convert it</font>. Be careful so that you don't have to cancel the effect.<br>
