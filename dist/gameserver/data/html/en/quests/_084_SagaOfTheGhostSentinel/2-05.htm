Sagittarius's bow was stolen?<br1>
A few days ago someone was asking about The Bow.<br1>
What? You want me to tell you about him for free?<br1>
You want me to starve?<br1>
Hahaha...<br1>
Well, I don't want to get any this time.<br1>
Instead, bring me an Ice Crystal Gemstone. Gemcutter Gedrik at the blacksmith shop in Goddard Castle can make the best Ice Crystal Gemstone.<br1>
Town. Once I have the gemstone, that promotion will be mine!
