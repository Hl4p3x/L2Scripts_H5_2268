Hunters Guild President Bernard:<br>
Thank you so much!<br1>
You'll be well-rewarded if you solve this problem.<br1>
It's only fair, right? Ha!<br1>
Whoever stole my bow was a very cunning thief. He took it right from under my nose!<br1>
I'll wager that Information Broker Grimst knows about this robbery. You should ask him for the details.<br1>
Oh, by the way, this book was found at the scene of the crime.<br1>
You should get going!
