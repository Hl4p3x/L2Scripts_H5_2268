Maestro Nikola:<br>
Go to <font color="LEVEL">Luka, a seller of blueprints at the smithy in the town of Oren</font>. I'm only slightly acquainted with him, but I am sure that he will be able to decode this password. I feel I must warn you, though -- he is somewhat lazy and is unlikely to help you without some kind of compensation.<br>
I know he is passionate about the <font color="LEVEL">accessories worn by the Leto Lizardmen found on the Plains of the Lizardmen</font>. Get those accessories for him and I am sure he will help.
