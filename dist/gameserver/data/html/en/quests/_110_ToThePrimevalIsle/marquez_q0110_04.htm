Ha ha! Thank you for saying so. But my aching body knows the truth; those days have ended for me. Lately I have at least tried to pass my knowledge on to younger adventurers by writing an account of my experiences on the island.<br>
I started by recounting both my own personal experiences and various stories I learned from the natives.

<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 110 3">"Tell him that you are not interested and will just leave."</a>
