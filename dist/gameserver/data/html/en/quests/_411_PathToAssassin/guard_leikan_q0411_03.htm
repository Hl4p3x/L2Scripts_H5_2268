Guard Leikan:<br>
Actually, I recently boasted to my colleagues that I was attacked by moonstone beasts while returning from the Dark Forest, and that I killed several. My colleagues didn't believe me and asked to see proof. This put me in a rather ... awkward position.<br>
So you see, I need ten moonstone beast molars. Please get some for me. You can easily find moonstone beasts north of here in the <font color="LEVEL">Neutral Zone</font>.<br>
Take this memo. It is a simple contract stating our agreement. Remember, <font color="LEVEL">you must bring back ten moonstone beast molars and then I will give you information.</font>
