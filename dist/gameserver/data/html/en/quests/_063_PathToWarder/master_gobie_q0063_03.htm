Master Gobie:<br>
(Reads the documents carefully.)<br>
Hmm... Good job...<br>
I will analyze the information you collected and
draft futher orders for you...<br>
(Master Gobie scribbles a note.)<br>
Here, take this letter to Captain Bathis of the Town
of Gludio and return to me.<br>
While you deliver this, i will despatch our elite Xekerin Troops to
capture Tak, a staff officer of the OI Mahum.<br>
Go quickly!
