Master Gobie:<br>
Well, if you  say so...<br>
I have my doubts, but our options are limited.<br>
Do it, then!<br>
According to a report one of our men found on
the body of one Xekerin Troops, Tak is
hiding with the Maille Lizardmen.<br>
Take this Soul Crystal and go to the Maille
Lizardmen Barraks. If you slay the Maille
Lizardmen, Tak, a staff officer of the OI Mahum,
will appear.<br>
When Tak is sufficiently weakened, he can be captured
using this Soul Crystal.<br>
Good hunting!
