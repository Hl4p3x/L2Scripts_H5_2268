Master Sione<br>
Our Kamael Steelfile is different from other
combat groups. We are a apecial force particularly
suited for information gathering, reporting,
determitins, attacking supply lines and
conducting raids behind enemy lines.<br>
These activities suit natural abilities of
female Kamael, which is why our unit was
formed.<br>
Our Steelfile exam is no different... We will
examine your skills to see if and where you
would fit into our overall strategy...<br>
We have a good mission available for your test.
Do your best!<br>
