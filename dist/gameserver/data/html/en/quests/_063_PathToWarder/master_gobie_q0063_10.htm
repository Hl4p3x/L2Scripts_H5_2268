Master Gobie:<br>
Ah! You have returned.<br>
And i see this has been another eventful errand...<br>
I too have been confused when dealing with
some of these other races.<br>
The races of the Outer World and the evil
creatures have complicated relations...<br>
Still, as an intelligence officer, it is my task to
make sense of all this conflicting information.<br>
As you wrote in you report, we do not know
whether the races of the Outer World and the evil
creatures communicate secretly or use each
other to gain thier ends..<br>
Certaintly, the relations between them are complicated
and often bloody.<br>
