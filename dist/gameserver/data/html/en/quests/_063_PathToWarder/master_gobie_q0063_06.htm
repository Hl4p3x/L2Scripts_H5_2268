Master Gobie:<br>
Speak up! Captain Bathis must have treated you
with contempt, eh ?<br>
A good lession fro you, is that not all the races in
this Outer World see us the same way.<br>
Some respect us as equals, others see us simply
as sword fodder in battle.<br>
Even individuals within a race treat us differently...<br>
As newcomers to the mainland, we dare not risk offending any
of these reces now.<br>
In fact, our orders are to provide assistance to
each of them impartially.<br>
So, we must learn to govern our tempers...<br>
