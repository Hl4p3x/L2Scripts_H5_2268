Master Sione:<br>
Soldier, I was an officer of the force that ventured into the outer world to collect information while you were still in training on the island.<br>
I am sure you understand that female Kamael are better at more refined, skill-oriented combat techniques than those that rely on sheer physical strength.<br>
Come see me again after you have acquired enough experience to take the test to become a Warder.<br>
(Only characters level 18 and above may undertake this quest.)
