Master Gobie:<br>
Hmmm... We have lost contact with the Xekerin
Troops. That is not necessarily unusual during an
operation, but they have remained out of contact
longer this time...<br>
Still, since they are all elite warriors, i am not overly
concerned... yet.<br>
I do have an another document for you to deliver.<br>
Take this to Grand Master Tobias of the Dark Elf Guild
in the Town of Gludio and return.
