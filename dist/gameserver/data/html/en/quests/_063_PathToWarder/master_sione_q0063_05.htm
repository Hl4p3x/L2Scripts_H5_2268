Master Sione<br>
I see... For you to obtain the right to become a Warder, you
must pass the Steelfile exam for the Kamael special forces unit.<br>
Be warned: you will be tested by experienced warriors who have developed their skills as
Warders...<br>
I am in charge of class transfer, but there is also a commander with the Steelfile...<br>
