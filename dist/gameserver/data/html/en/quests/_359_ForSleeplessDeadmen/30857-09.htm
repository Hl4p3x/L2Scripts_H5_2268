Great! You already know what to do. I'll need you to bring me  <font color="LEVEL">Aden Residents Remains</font> from the undead around <font color="LEVEL">Devastated Castle.</font> Our dead brothers came back from death in the form of <font color="LEVEL">doom archers, doom guards and doom servants.</font> Given the power i can concentrate in a single ceremony you should take exactly <font color="LEVEL">60 corpses</font> before you come back. Now please hurry, our brave soldiers deserve a proper rest!
