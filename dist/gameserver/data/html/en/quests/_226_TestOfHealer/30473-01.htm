Priest Bandellos:<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">Mark of the Healer</font> is only given to those who have perceived the healing and purifying power of light properly. This rule applies for all tribes, and there are no exceptions or changes. Someday, you will also have to take the exam to receive this mark. But at the moment you are not ready yet. You don't need to be hasty, though.<br>
As long as you don't give up, you will surely get to meet me again as an even mature person. On that day, I shall ask you a favor...<br>
(Quest available only for Cleric, Oracle, Human Knights or Elven Knights above level 39.)
