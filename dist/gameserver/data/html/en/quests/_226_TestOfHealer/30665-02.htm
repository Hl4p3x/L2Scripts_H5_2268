Saintess kristina:<br>
The Dark Elf who kidnapped me said something strange. That the Goddess is already waking up... Although I do not know what it means.<br>
But I realized one thing for sure. That this was my destiny, to be kidnapped here...<br>
I shall remain here. It is not yet time for me to go back to the shrine. It is my duty to spread the words of light in the forest of darkness. The Dark Elves have the right to know about the truth of light, as well. To survive the days of Chaotic Chronicle, we all need to cooperate.<br>
I want you to deliver this letter to <font color="LEVEL">Master Sorius</font>. Please.
