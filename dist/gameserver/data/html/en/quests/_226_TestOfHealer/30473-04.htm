Priest Bandellos:<br>
There is a long-time-inherited revelation. Some day, when people suffer from dark energy filling this world, there will be a girl, as a representative of Einhasad who shall purify this world.<br>
And right now there is this <font color="LEVEL">girl who claims that she is the 'one'</font>. Whether she is telling the truth or not, the church cannot be indifferent about it.<br>
I want you to examine this matter carefully. This will be your examination.<br>
First, meet this guy called  <font color="LEVEL">Perin of the Gludin</font>. It is said that he is protecting the holy woman.
