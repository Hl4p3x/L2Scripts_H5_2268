I have a basic idea of your situation... Could I take a look at the Contract?
This is the mark of the Silver Scale guild. <font color="LEVEL">Trader Rolento</font> is the only Dwarf in this area who belongs to that guild... However, he would never supply weapons to the ol mahums...<br>
I'm sure there must have been a misunderstanding! Or, maybe someone framed him... If you met him you would realize that I know what I'm talking about. Please! Go and meet Rolento at the <font color="LEVEL">south entrance of the Wasteland</font>, you'll realize he would never have done such a thing.
