Guard Coleman:<br>
Have you witnessed the current condition of the Cemetery?<br>
The final resting place of kings, aristocrats and heroes has fallen into ruin and been overtaken by hideous monsters. Our neglect tempts our ancestors' wrath.<br>
At Captain Kurtiz's direction, we have begun to try to drive out the monsters, but we have not been very effective so far.<br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 360 guard_coleman_q0360_03.htm">Is there any other way to solve this problem?</a>
