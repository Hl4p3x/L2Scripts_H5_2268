Guard Coleman:<br>
Captain Kurtiz says that in order to wipe them out completely, the Taik orc seeker and the Taic ork supply leader must be stopped from giving supplies to the monsters.<br>
But alas, our guards are having a hard time dealing with their forces. The captain has ordered me to find someone who can kill them for us.<br>
You seem capable of doing it. Are you willing to help us? We will pay you a generous reward.<br>
