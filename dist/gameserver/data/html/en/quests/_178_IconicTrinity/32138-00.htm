Hierarch Kekropus:<br>
The time has come for you to leave this Island. Before you leave, there is something you must know, a hidden truth about the Kamael.<br>
Knowing this truth may place you in danger, which is why only those who have exhibited exceptional courage and skill are offered the chance to learn it. From what I have seen, you are not yet ready...<br>
(Only Kamael characters over level 17 may undertake this quest.)
