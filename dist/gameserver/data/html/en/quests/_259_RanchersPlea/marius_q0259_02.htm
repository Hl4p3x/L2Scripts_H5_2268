Marius:<br>
May the blessings of the starlight fall upon you. So you are the mercenary hired by my colleague Edmond. I was once a Knight with a sword... But... something happened and I pledged not to touch a sword again. I am retired now.<br>
I felt terrible that I haven't been able to help Edmond. Thankfully, I owe you gratitude for volunteering to kill these spiders for us.<br>
Tell me if you need anything. <font color="LEVEL">I will exchange two healing potions, fifty arrows, 60 soulshots or 30 spiritshots for ten giant spider husks.</font><br>
