You don't know how to use a spiritshot? OK, here's a brief explanation:<br>
A spiritshot enhances a weapon with the explosive energy of a powerful spirit. Blessed spiritshots are even more powerful. Each spiritshot only works once, so you will need multiple spiritshots if you intend to use them successively.<br>
A good Mystic will always have enough spiritshots to save himself and his party in a crisis.<br>
Spiritshots may only be used with weapons that are designed to absorb spirit energy. The grade of weapon must match the grade of the spiritshot.
