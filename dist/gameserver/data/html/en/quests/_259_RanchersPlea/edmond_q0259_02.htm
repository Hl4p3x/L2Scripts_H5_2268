Edmond:<br>
Welcome, traveler. I originally resided in Gludio, but lost my family during the war with Gracia and moved here to start a new life.<br>
I am trying to ranch here with my old friend, Marius. We were going to take our sheep to the sunny hillside right back there and turn them out to pasture ... But the giant spiders showed up, and we lost all thirty sheep that we brought from Innadril.<br>
We are going to hire mercenaries with the money the governor granted us and drive off the giant spiders from this area. It looks like you know how to fight ...*Do you think you could exterminate those spiders for us?*<br>
