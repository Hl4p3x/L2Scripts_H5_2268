Trader Kunai:<br>
On behalf of the Duda-Mara tribe, I thank you! There is much to do...<br>
In order to discover the source of this curse, we require a medium. Once the Kasha Spider was our sacred symbol, and even though it has been corrupted by this fiend, it will still be suitable for our purposes.<br>
Go to the <font color="LEVEL">northern region of the Immortal Plateau</font>. There you must slay <font color="LEVEL">Kasha Spiders, Kasha Fang Spiders and Kasha Blade Spiders</font> and bring me <font color="LEVEL">30 Contaminated Kasha Spider Venom samples</font>. With them, I will be able to determine the source of this evil.<br>
Naturally, you will be rewarded for your efforts.
