Fine work. Haha! Thank you for eliminating those pesky monks. So, would you like to collect your just rewards?<br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 639 falsepriest_dominic_q0639_07.htm">Don't collect the rewards now.</a><br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 639 falsepriest_dominic_q0639_08.htm">Get the rewards in exchange for the Scripture of Monk you brought.</a>
