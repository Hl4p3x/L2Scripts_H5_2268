Warehouse Keeper Haprock:<br>
First, take this! It may not be much, but please accept it as a token of thanks for your work. It is more than enough money to cover your travel expenses from the <font color="LEVEL">Dark Elven Village</font> to here.<br>
And what I want you to do is ... <font color="LEVEL">deliver a letter</font> to <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Keeper Norman</font> of the <font color="LEVEL">village of Gludin</font>. The letter came in a bundle of mail delivered from the Dwarven Kingdom a few days ago, and normally it would be sent on to <font color="LEVEL">Gludin</font> on one of the carriages that will leave for <font color="LEVEL">Gludin</font> in a few weeks. But I know how <font color="LEVEL">Norman</font> is hungry for news from home, so I am asking you to deliver it now.<br>
Actually, <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Keeper Norman</font> has a wife at home who waits for her husband's return ... But Norman cannot return, as he has obligations to the guild ... They express their longing for each other by sending the occasional letter. A lonely man who longs for his wife in a faraway land ... doesn't that make your heart ache?<br>
So please, make sure to deliver this letter to <font color="LEVEL">Norman</font>. He will be very thankful. Of course, he will compensate you for your efforts.
