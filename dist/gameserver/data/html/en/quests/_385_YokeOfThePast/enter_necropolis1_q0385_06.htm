Gatekeeper Ziggurat:<br>
The Guardians are <font color="LEVEL">the undead and demons</font> summoned by the wicked shamans who serve the goddess of death. These creatures are bound here, to protect this sepulchre from the Cross Army of Light.<br>
They call themselves <font color="LEVEL">Lookout, Watcher, Guard, Monk, Overlord, Shaman, Consul, Inquisitor, Guardian, Elder, Court Guard and Preacher.</font><br>
But you must not harm Nephilim, Lilim, Gigant and Lilith. They are soldiers of the gods, most holy warriors, and you dare not raise your sword against them.
