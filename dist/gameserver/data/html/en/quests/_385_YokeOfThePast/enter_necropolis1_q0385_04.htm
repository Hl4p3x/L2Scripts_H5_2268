Gatekeeper Ziggurat:<br>
The followers of ancient magic possess <font color="LEVEL">scrolls of ancient magic</font> containing forbidden magic power. If these scrolls were to fall into the wrong hands, it could cause quite a disturbance. I cannot let this happen. Please recover the scrolls of ancient magic from the ancients in the dungeon...<br>
Will you do this for me?<br>
