Warehouse Keeper Norman:<br>
Oh yes! That's right. You said that you were in the middle of taking a test to be a union member?<br>
A Genieman's Jewel is not something you can get from somewhere, you have to make it yourself. But the skills of making it is not something that can be taught in a short time...<br>
I shall make one for you instead of teaching you the skills.<br>
First you must find me the materials needed to make the jewel. Any objection to going and finding the materials for yourself? You didn't expect such and old man like me to run around and collect the materials, did you?<br>
