Warehouse Keeper Norman:<br>
First of all we need some <font color="LEVEL">Gray Bone Powder</font> to use as the abrasive. You can get it from undead monsters such as <font color="LEVEL">ghouls</font> or <font color="LEVEL">strains</font>. I heard that there are plenty in the execution place of Dion.<br>
And I also need a <font color="LEVEL">Granite Whetstone</font> which is for processing the surface of the jewel... It would be best if you can find a piece of <font color="LEVEL">granite golem</font>!<br>
Other necessary things would be... The <font color="LEVEL">Red Pigment</font>! Which you can get from the <font color="LEVEL">dead seeker</font> bat in the Execution Ground. Last, we need some <font color="LEVEL">Braided Yarn</font>. That you can get by hunting the <font color="LEVEL">silenos</font> in Giran...<br>
Did you memorize everything? Don't forget it this time.
