Please accept my apologies -- the amount of money we've managed to scrape together is far too small compared to what you've done for us. But we have few merchants, and many of them have been robbed by thieves. I blush to say it, but this is really the best we can do...<br>
I know you have no expectation of payment, but we wanted to do something to show our gratitude. Since the amount is miniscule, I added some to it myself. Please accept this.<br>
Were a hardy adventurer like yourself to keep capturing the raiders, I'm sure that our merchants' situation would dramatically improve... What do you say? Will you continue your efforts on our behalf?<br>
