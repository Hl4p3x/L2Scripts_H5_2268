Watcher of Valakas Klein:<br>
Ah… so determined I see. Are you sure you are ready to face Valakas? You may wish to reconsider.<br>
A thought in my mind, years of being stopped by adventurers like you can do horrible things to a dragon’s spirit. Imagine all that pure rage combined with his newly found power... one could only hope that Valakas doesn’t like to play with his food.<br>
You aren’t the first adventurer I’ve given this speech to. Last chance. Are you sure you are ready?<br>
