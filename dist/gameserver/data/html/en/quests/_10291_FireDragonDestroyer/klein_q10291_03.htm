Watcher of Valakas Klein:<br>
I can see that you are determined despite my warnings. I will not try to stop you any further from your haste to find a quick death.<br>
However, should you be one of the lucky few to actually survive the encounter with Valakas you will need proof that you have defeated the Fire Dragon.<br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 10291 klein_q10291_04.htm">Ask about proof.</a>
