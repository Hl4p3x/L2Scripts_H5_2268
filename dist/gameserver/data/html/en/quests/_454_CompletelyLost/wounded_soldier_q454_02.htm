Injured Soldier:<br>
Th, thank you. If General Ermian is still alive, I'd bet he's set up camp somewhere safe.<br>
But it would be best if it doesn't take too long. As you can see, I've been wounded and it won't be long until I either bleed out or disease takes it toll.<br>
If you're prepared, let's depart.<br>
