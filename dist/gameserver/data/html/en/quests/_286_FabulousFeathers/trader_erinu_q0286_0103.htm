Trader Erinu:<br>
When you enter Nornil's Cave, you will encounter bird-like humanoid creatures called Muertos. Among them are <font color="LEVEL">Captains, Warriors, Archers, Leaders and Wizards</font>, all of which can be distinguished by their powerful wings.<br>
Some Humans will pay a premium for Muertos feathers to use as decorations for accessories and weapons.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Collect at least 80 feathers</font> and bring them to me.
