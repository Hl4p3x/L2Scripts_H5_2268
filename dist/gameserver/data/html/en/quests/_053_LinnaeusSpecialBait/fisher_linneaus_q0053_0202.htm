You said you'd brought all of the <font color="LEVEL">Crimson Drake's Hearts</font>, but they are not enough. 
I cannot make <font color="LEVEL">Bait of Flame</font> containing the power of flame with these. 
Even though you are a famous soldier, you have to bring me the right materials for making it.
