Guard Harlan:<br>
Oh, great! Please bring me 80 <font color="LEVEL">leaves of eucalyptus</font>... That should be enough for one barrel of wine.<br>
I'll need some <font color="LEVEL">stones of chill</font> to properly age the wine... 100 should be enough.<br>
If you bring me these items, I'll give you a genuine bottle of Dion wine! No cost is too high for the sake of my precious daughter!
