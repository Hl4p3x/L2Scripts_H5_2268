Hierarch Kekropus:<br>
Ah, you've come. So you have decided that you wish to meet N, eh?<br>
I am afraid that if you have already reached level 21 or completed your first class transfer, N will not wish to meet you.<br>
(Only Kamael over level 17 who have completed the Iconic Trinity quest and have fewer than 21 first class transfers may undertake this quest.)
