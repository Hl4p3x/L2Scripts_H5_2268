I admire your willingness to help but...<br>
Well, frankly your skills are not yet developed sufficiently to safely hunt the Keltir or the wolves.<br>

Perhaps you can come back after you have acquired a little more experience<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by characters level 3 or higher.)
