Gatekeeper Bella:<br>
Pets help their owners in a number of ways.<br>
If your inventory is low or you have exceeded your weight limit, you can use your pets to carry some of your items. Just be careful not to use your pets too often on errands, no matter how useful they may be.<br>
If your pets die, <font color="LEVEL">now you can resurrect them without the time limit of 24 hours</font>. No need to worry about losing your pets forever!<br>
