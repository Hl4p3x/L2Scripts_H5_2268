Pet Manager Martin:<br>
Let me see... There are several of those who abuse animals...<br>
Hey you -- Kamael! Why don't you go back to your homeland and take care of those animal killers? It's a simple quest, but worthwhile.<br>
In Mimir's Forest, you will find <font color="LEVEL">Crimson Spiders</font> , who are the worst trasgressors. They delight in feasting on animals for both food and pleasure, so the animals living near the forest are terribly endangered.<br>
Of course, I'll want you to bring me proof that you have kept your word. How can I be expected to believe you if you come back empty-handed, eh? Any other questions? No? Then good luck!
