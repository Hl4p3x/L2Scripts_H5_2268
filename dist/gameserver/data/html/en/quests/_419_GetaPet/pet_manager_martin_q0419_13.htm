Pet Manager Martin:<br>
So, have you met the members of the Animal Lovers Association like I asked? Well done! Now I will test the knowledge that you've learned from our members. There are ten questions in all. If you make even one mistake, you'll fail the examination and won't be able to get a pet!<br>
As soon as you decide to take the test, you'll have your questions. What do you say, are you ready for the test?<br>
