Prefect Vokiyan:<br>
Breka Orcs! Those who deserve to be doomed! Filthy betrayers who degraded the dignity of Orcs! Did you say that the serpent's egg found in the devil's nest has been delivered to the Breka Orcs? Yes...I remember that the old totem of the Breka Orcs was 'a coiled serpent'...<br>
According to Seer Manakia, the Breka Orcs are preparing a big ceremony right now... Perhaps the serpent's egg has something to do with the ceremony!<br>
I want you to go there. Go and kill every single <font color="LEVEL">Chief and Shaman of the Breka Orcs</font> that you confront, and find out everything that's going on there! In case you find something like a <font color="LEVEL">Serpent-Shaped Charm</font> bring it back to me!
