Ah, you're back. Well? What's this? Judging from the lack of <font color="LEVEL">Vulture's Golden Feathers</font>, it looks as if you defeated only a few <font color="LEVEL">Vulture Riders and Elite Riders</font> but did not face their leader, <font color="LEVEL">Master Rider Valdstone</font>. Here's the reward I promised you, but unless you defeat the Valdstone our fortress is still in danger. Will you keep hunting?<br>
