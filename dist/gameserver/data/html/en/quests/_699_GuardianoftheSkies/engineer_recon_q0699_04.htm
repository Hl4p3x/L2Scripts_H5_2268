Engineer Lekon:<br>
You certainly don't lack for bravery.<br>
Now go defeat bring <font color="LEVEL">Master Rider Valdstone</font> near the Keucereus Alliance Base and bring me a <font color="LEVEL">Vulture's Golden Feather</font> from his mount as proof.<br>
According to what I've heard, the vulture that Valdstone rides is much larger and fiercer than the others. Its feathers are blue when young, but become a golden color as the creature ages. Valdstone's mount should have plenty of golden feathers. Of course, you will be rewarded for all feathers taken from <font color="LEVEL">Vulture Rider</font> mounts.<br>
Eh? Why are you looking at me like that? You don't think I'm more concerned with the feather than I am defeating the Valdstone and his riders? Oh...well, of course the feather is very precious in its own right... But you must defeat these pirates and protect the safety of our air space! Hurry!
