Hierarch Kekropus:<br>
I cannot say for certain, but...<br1>
Listen carefully to what I have to say.<br1>
Several decades before the seal was unbound, a man in black armor and a woman in a blue dress came to me. and said that Shilen's power was growing greater. To oppose her, our power was needed.<br1>
They said that the beings who had sought our destruction in the past were now distracted and weakened.<br1>
So for the intervening years, I have trained you younger Kamael to sharpen your fighting skills even further.<br1>
During that time, the man in black armor and the woman in the blue dress visited the island from time to time to moniter our progress...<br1>
I cannot tell you their true identities, but suffice it to say that they were no mere mortals beings.<br1>
Although conditions to release the seal were favorable, they still wished that we not draw the undue attention of the being who hated us so long ago, so the upper limits of our true power remained sealed, even from us.<br1>
But the woman in the blue dress fashioned it so that a skilled Kamael who proved worthy of that power would be able to unlock the seal and wield the full range of our abilities.<br1>
It is not an easy process, however...<br>
