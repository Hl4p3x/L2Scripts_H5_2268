Magister Justin:<br>
As a magician and a scholar, my insterest in life energy is extremely keen.<br1>
While studying the Kamael, I have come to learn about the Tablet of Vision and the existence of the teaching stone.<br1>
However, journeying to those dangerous places myself in search of the stone is too arduous.<br1>
Instead, I have found a substitute material that can assist me in my research.<br>
