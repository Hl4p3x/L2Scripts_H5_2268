Warehouse Freightman Stefano:<br>
The cell tissues that Justin needs are very fragile, and if they are less than perfect they are completely unusable.<br1>
It is possible to transport them using a special low temperature treatment, but we will need icicles for the procedure.<br1>
Bring me the icicles and I'll be able to complete the treatment.<br1>
Ask Chef Jeremy in the Hot Springs region where to obtain icicles.
