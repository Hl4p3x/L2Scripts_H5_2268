Hierarch Kekropus:<br>
This will be a very dangerous and difficult journey.<br1>
But from what I have seen of you thus far, I think you are up to the challenge.<br1>
...<br1>
As I have already said, you will need an object called the Resonance Amulet in order to communicate with the Tablet of Vision.<br1>
This was created in order to prevent the knowledge of the Tablet from falling into the wrong hands.<br1>
According to my research, the first Resonance Amulet is in the possession of Magister Justin in Goddard Castle Town. Go find him.<br1>
Be warned, though: Beleth's minions may also be seeking the Resonance Amulet and may try to stop you.
