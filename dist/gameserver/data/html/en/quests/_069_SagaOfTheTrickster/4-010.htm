Rodenpicula:<br>
I have avoided pursuing my vendetta against the goddess of light because I hoped that the time would come when I could bequeath this magical stone to one of my heirs capable of attaining true power and insight.<br1>
Now use that Resonance Amulet wisely.<br1>
I do not know how you will deal with the truth -- that we were all created as weapons to help the Giants oppose the gods...<br1>
But bear this in mind: the future is open to you, and you must now judge how to use your strength for yourself.<br1>
...<br1>
I must pursue and destroy our injured enemies...<br1>
Farewell...<br>
