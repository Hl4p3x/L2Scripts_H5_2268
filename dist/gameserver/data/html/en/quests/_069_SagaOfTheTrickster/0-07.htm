Hierarch Kekropus:<br>
The Giants who created us are long gone, and we are beings with free will.<br1>
Once the Isle of Souls was unsealed, my obligation to our former masters ended. The only thing I still feel compelled to do is share the truth with you...<br1>
Our future as a race will depend on the strength and wisdom of those like yourself.<br1>
You already know of our fighting skills, but that is not all that seperates us from the other races.<br1>
We are unique in that we are not bound by the same gods-decreed fate that binds the other races.<br1>
You know the truth about our race and you have obtained the power of the Trickster.<br1>
How you use that power depends entirely on you. I trust that you will use it well both for the Kamael for the world itself.<br1>
Congratulations, Trickster.
