Cheiren:<br>
You have brought back 10 Soul Core Containing Evil Spirits.. If I combine the power of this core with this pendant... Well, these are the <font color="LEVEL">Protection Soul's Pendant</font>. These are essential to confront the head of Raguna Orc <font color="LEVEL">Baranka</font>. Without these items, one can never be able to endure the energy of the evil spirit.<br>
If you go to the altar of Kasha and kill it, it will be of a great help to weaken the evil spirit.<br>
Anything else?<br>
