Tablet of Vision:<br>
You feel a strange, disconnected force enter your body.<br1>
The tablet seems to be communicating with you. You see a vision of a Human, standing before a house engulfed in a dark aura.<br1>
It seems to located on the road from the Ketra Orc Outpost to Goddard Castle Town.<br1>
You feel the Tablet of Vision weakening.
