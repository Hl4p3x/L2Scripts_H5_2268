I am the best hunter among all the members of the Hunter's Guild! Ha Ha Ha!<br1>
Uggh. I, ah... feel a little bit tipsy, now...<br1>
Now, I've become a fisher... no, the best drunkard in Goddard! Bwa Ha Ha! Isn't it fun? Are you having fun, yet? I know how you can have even more fun. Well now, go to Valentine and bring me back some of his ice liquor!
