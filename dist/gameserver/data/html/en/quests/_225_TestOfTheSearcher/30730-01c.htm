Bodyguard Jax:<br>
Solt and I were very close... He died on his way home to Elmoreden. Murdered by thieves called <font color="LEVEL">Road Scavengers</font>...<br>
Makell was the idealist, he joined the rebel army... In the end, he was caught and executed. His body was hung from a tree as a reminder to others... This tree grew animated, and is now known as the <font color="LEVEL">Hanged Man Ripper</font>.<br>
Rambert was very much like me, working as a high trader's Guard. He lost his life in battle with a delu lizardman. <br>
And now you hold the map!<br>
