Trader Tyra:<br>
The Malrukian Wine is of the highest quality, which was made by distilling the spider's poison. The secrets of making it is only inherited by the chosen ones, even among the Dark Elves. I cannot give it out to just anyone.<br>
I shall make a proposal. If you can find *10 pouches of the Red Spore Dust *I shall trade them with the wine. What do you say? Will you accept my proposal?<br>
