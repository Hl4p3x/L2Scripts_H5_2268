Trader Tyra:<br>
Did you forget our contract? Shall we take a look at the papers? <font color="LEVEL">'A bottle of Malrukian Wine shall be traded with 10 pouches of the Red Spore Dust'</font>. You can see our signatures, both mine and yours, down here. You'll be able to get the Red Spore Dust by killing the <font color="LEVEL">giant fungus</font> of the <font color="LEVEL">Sea of Spores</font>. I hope you fulfill the contract soon.
