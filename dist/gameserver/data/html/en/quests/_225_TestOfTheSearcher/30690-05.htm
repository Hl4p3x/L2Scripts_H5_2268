Master Luther:<br>
Then first of all you must visit <font color="LEVEL">Alex in Floran Village</font>. He was once known as the kingdom's best Scout, and is also famous for his activities as King Cadmus' immediate spy and messenger at the time of the war with Grecia.<br>
But he was too disappointed by the royal family and aristocrats at the time of the peasant's uprising and now he is fighting in the militia corps of Floran. They say that they are having a hard time with lack of soldiers and supplies. So and see him.<br>
I will ask Alex to test you and write a letter of recommendation if he feels that you are qualified.
