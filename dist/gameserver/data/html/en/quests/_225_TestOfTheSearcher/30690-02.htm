Master Luther:<br>
Did you come for the Mark of the Searcher? The Searcher's Mark is given to those who's ability for 'finding hidden things' is recognized.
Every year, numerous Hunters, Scouts, Excavators and even some Assassins come to me in hope of receiving the

(Quest only available for Rogue, Scout, Assassin, or Scavenger above level 39.)
