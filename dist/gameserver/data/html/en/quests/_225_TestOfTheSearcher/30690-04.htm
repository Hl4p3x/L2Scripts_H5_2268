Master Luther:<br>
Did you come for the Mark of the Searcher? The Mark is given to those who's ability for 'finding hidden things' is recognized. Every year, numerous Hunters, Scouts, Excavators and even some Assassins come to me in hope of receiving the <font color="LEVEL">Test of the Searcher</font> but a Dwarf like you.... Are you a Master Raider applicant by any chance? I heard that they were the best Hunters among the Dwarfs. But even within the Dwarf Guild, not everybody is given such title... It is said that only those who have proven their hunting skills and acquired the Mark of the Searcher are qualified for a Master Raider. If you wish to take the examination, I will gladly arrange it for you.<br>
