Fishermen's Guild Member O'Fulle:<br>
I may look chipper, but I feel terrible!  Recently a delivery of ingredients for our bait of chill was hijacked by <font color="LEVEL">fettered souls</font> at the <font color="LEVEL">Death Pass</font>! 
It was several years worth of supplies! A devastating loss!<br>
Are you here for bait? Sorry, I couldn't make any if I wanted to. What can I do? <br>
