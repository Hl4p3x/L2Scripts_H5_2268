Sir Klaus Vasper:<br>
I am taking care of three swords right now. The first one is the 'Sword of Ritual' which is used in every knighting ceremony, the second is the 'Sword of Chastity' which one of our family ancestors received from the forest lady Ordana. And the last one is the <font color="LEVEL">Sword of Binding</font> which Artreus, the hero of Elmoraden used to seal the magic creatures of Shilen.<br>
