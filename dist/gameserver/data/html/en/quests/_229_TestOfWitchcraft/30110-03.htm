Master Iker:<br>
All right, this is what I need.<br>
First, the <font color="LEVEL">Teeth of the Worm</font> that lives in the <font color="LEVEL">Sea of Spores</font>. <font color="LEVEL">20 of them</font> should be enough.<br>
You must also bring me the the <font color="LEVEL">Leto Lizardman's Amulet</font>. You can find the leto lizardmen in the <font color="LEVEL">southern parts of Oren</font>. You must bring me <font color="LEVEL">20 of these</font>.<br>
And last, I need the <font color="LEVEL">Stoneheart of the strengthened stone golems</font> that may be found near the <font color="LEVEL">Ivory Tower</font>. I will need <font color="LEVEL">20 of these</font>...<br>
These are quite a few items so I've written them down for you.  Bring them to me and you shall have your jewel...
