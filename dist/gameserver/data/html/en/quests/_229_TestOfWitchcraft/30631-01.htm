Warden Roderik:<br>
Ismell? He passed here a few days ago with pale face. These days the undead have been exceptionally active so I tried to dissuade him from going into the execution place, but he refused to listen to me saying that he can't afford to lose a precious thing.<br>
Afterwards a terrible shriek could be heard and he never returned since then. I suppose he turned into one of those '<font color="LEVEL">nameless souls</font>' wandering about the Execution Ground.
