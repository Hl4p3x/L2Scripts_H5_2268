Magister Kaira:<br>
I heard that Orim of the Shadows is looking for this jewel.... Are you the one he sent here? No doubt. I can see it. But do you know what kind of jewel this is? What did he tempt you with? Do you think that you can achieve the secret of Black magic just with this jewel?<br>
If you are stupid enough to believe what Orim said, I will hand you the jewel. Just keep this in mind. To obtain knowledge you have to pay its price. The first rule in Black magic is 'You lose as much as you get'.<br>
