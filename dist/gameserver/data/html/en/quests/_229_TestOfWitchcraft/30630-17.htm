Orim of the Shadow:<br>
To lock the devil Zeruel back into the box, we need to have 2 things. One is the <font color="LEVEL">Sword of Binding</font>, and the other is the <font color="LEVEL">Soul-trap Crystal</font>.<br>
Sword of Binding belongs to Sir Klaus Vasper, and the Soul-trap Crystal is owned by Master Iker of Giran. Neither of them are in favor of Witchcraft, so it won't be easy win their cooperation.
