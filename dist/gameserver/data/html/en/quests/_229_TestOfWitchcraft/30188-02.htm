Priest Vadin:<br>
Did you complete the trial that I gave you? Let me remind you of the trial, you should kill the <font color="LEVEL">Tamlin Orcs</font> and bring <font color="LEVEL">20 talismans</font> as proof. If you complete the trial, I shall approve that your resolution and faith are firm, and give you the permission to use the Sword of Binding.
