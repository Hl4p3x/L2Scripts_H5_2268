Master Ellenia:<br>
The eradication of the plague bringers has begun! Please hurry to the abandoned <font color="LEVEL">Underground Elven Fortress</font>. Do you remember the contract you signed with me? Destroy the dirty <font color="LEVEL">ratmen</font> and bring back their <font color="LEVEL">fangs</font> as proof, and I will reward you for each item of proof you bring me. I will give you an exceptionally large reward if you kill their leader, <font color="LEVEL">Varool Foulclaw</font>, and bring me one of his fangs.<br>
