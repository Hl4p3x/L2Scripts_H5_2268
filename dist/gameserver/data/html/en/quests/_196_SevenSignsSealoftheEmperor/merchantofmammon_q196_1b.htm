Merchant of Mammon:<br>
The power to move between planes, child!<br>
We first used it to travel from Necropolis to Necropolis, but soon augmented our device to allow us travel on a different axis: <font color="LEVEL">time itself</font>.<br>
We called it <font color="LEVEL">'The Promise of Mammon'</font>. It was the most powerful creation in Aden's history, and a tool that Emperor Shunaiman was granted access to in that contract of ours.<br>
