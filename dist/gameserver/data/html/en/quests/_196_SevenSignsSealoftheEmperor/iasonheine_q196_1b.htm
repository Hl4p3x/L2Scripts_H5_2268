Here... it says that Shunaiman and the merchants entered into a secret pact, but only half of the deal is mentioned here: the merchants agreed to aid the Emperor whenever his Seal was under threat.<br>
But no merchant worth his salt would agree to a clause like that without getting something in return--so what DID they demand? And why isn't it on this page? Hmm....<br>
That's not all either.<br>
