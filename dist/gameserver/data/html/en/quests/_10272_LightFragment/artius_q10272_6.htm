Hmmm... Very interesting. I think that means that we should gain the power of darkness and turn it to light.<br>
I know what we should do. Seed of Destruction is swarming with drakes, all of them are carrying the fragment of darkness. We should collect them and use divine power.<br>
But first of all, your task is following: kill <font color="LEVEL">Dragon Steed Troop Infantry, Dragon Steed Troop Javelin Thrower, Dragon Steed Troop Healer, Dragon Steed Troops No 1 Battalion Commander, Dragon Steed Troop Commander, Dragon Steed Troop Magic Leader, Dragon Steed Troop Grand Magician, Defeated Troops Infantry, Defeated Troops Javelin Thrower, Defeated Troops Healer, Defeated Troops No 1 Battalion Commander, Defeated Troops Commander, Defeated Troops Magic Soldier, Defeated Troops Magician, Defeated Troops Magic Leader, Defeated Troops White Dragon Leader, Warrior of Light, Royal Guard Captain, White Dragon Leader, and Soldiers of Bravery</font> in Seed of Destruction.
 
Obtain <font color="LEVEL">100 Destroyed Darkness Fragment Powder</font> and bring them to me. <br>
