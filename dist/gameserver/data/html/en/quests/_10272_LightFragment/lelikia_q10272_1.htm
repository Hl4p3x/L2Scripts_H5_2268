Priest of Shilen Lelikia<br>
Greetings again, young adventurer.<br>
I heard last news, documents are very interesting and giving us a chance to strike at the heart of Drakans.<br>
I'm talking about Tiat, the Great Witch. She has very powerful transformation and there's a possibility to hurt her very hard.<br>
