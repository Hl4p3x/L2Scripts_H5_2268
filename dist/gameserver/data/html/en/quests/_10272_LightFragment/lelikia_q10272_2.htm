Priest of Shilen Lelikia<br>
Listen what I say and tell this to War Mage:<br>
*The power of darkness infuses the storm*<br1>
*And storm of the darkness can vitaly hurt*<br1>
*But darkness will strike only one who has light*<br1>
<font color="LEVEL">So bring piece of darkness to Einhazad's sight.</font><br>
Now you should leave. Have you remembered what I said?<br>
