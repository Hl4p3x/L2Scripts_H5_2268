Tablet of Vision:<br>
Countless thoughts beyond comprehension sear painfully into your brain. A female voice seems to float on by as if she were quietly laughing at you...<br1>
You sense the location of the next Stone of Commune...<br1>
It is being held by* someone with wings beside the Tablet of Vision along the southeastern Wall of the Argos*.
