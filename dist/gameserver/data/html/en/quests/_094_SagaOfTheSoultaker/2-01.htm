High Priest Gregory:<br>
Ah, I heard that you were coming!<br1>
Do you remember when Lich King Akron's gang slaughtered the priests of Goddard Castle Town, and then murdered the party sent out to search for them? I heard that Hindemith was seen with the gang at the site of the massacre, but why would he do such a thing?<br1>
I'm determined to get to the bottom of this, but as you can see, I can't just pick up and leave! Would you help me?<br1>
By the way...<br>
