High Priest Gregory:<br>
Asefa is the chief shaman and guide of dead souls of the Ketra Orcs. Udan Mardui holds the same position among the Varka Silenos. Each of them possesses a* Divine Stone of Wisdom* which is a* fragment of this Stone of Commune*. Bring one of the stones to me.<br1>
Both tribes seem vaguely aware that the stone contains powerful magic and mysterious knowledge, but they have no idea how to access it! They actually give it away as a prize to the person they think is smartest among them!<br1>
Prove your wisdom to Asefa of the Ketra Orcs or Udan Mardui of the Varka Silenos and they will give you the stone.<br1>
Which tribe would you prefer to obtain the stone from?<br>
