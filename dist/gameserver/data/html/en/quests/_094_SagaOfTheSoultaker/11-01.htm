High Priest Gregory:<br>
Oh, you're back! Did you find Hindemith? I suppose he'd already been there, eh? His pilgrimage of the stone tablets is nearing fulfillment. Once he's completed it, it will be impossible to find him! You must find him quickly!<br1>
I'll search for him as well...<br1>
I do have the Stone of Commune, but you can't have it. I'll need it to find Hindemith. I can tell you how to find your own stone, however...<br>
