Hardin:<br>
I knew it! Hindemith couldn't have done such a thing! This should relieve the pressure our guild has been under, and get Hindemith out from under a cloud as well.<br1>
By the way, while you were doing this, you've completed your own Pilgrimage of the Tablets of Vision.<br1>
Henceforth you shall be known as a Soultaker! Congratulations!
