Prefect Karukia:<br>
You accomplished the mission well, but don't get too sure of yourself! As an Orc Raider, that should've been nothing to you! Now you must prove your loyalty.<br>
Two Judges await you. Which do you want to go to?<br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 414 to_Gludin">"I want to go to Gludio Village"</a><br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 414 to_Schuttgart">"I want to go to the Town of Schuttgart"</a>
