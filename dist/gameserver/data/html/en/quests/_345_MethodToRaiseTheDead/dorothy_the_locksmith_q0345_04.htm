Not much, my friend... If i could, i would slice openthe bellies of all the damned crockians I could find! If I didn't locate the treasure. as leasr I would have my revenge, no?<br>
In fact, I would really appreciate it if you would go to the <font color="LEVEL">Field of Whispers</font> just outside the village and kill <font color="LEVEL">Crockians and Crockian warriors</font>. Their corpses should yeld the remains of my friends, and possibly more. Bring whatever you find back to me. Meanwhite, I will continue my investigation. If we find the treasure you will be gretly rewarded...
