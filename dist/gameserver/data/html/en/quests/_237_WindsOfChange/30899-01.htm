Gatekeeper Flauen:<br>
This place - my home - has been untouched by the passage of time.  But now, the winds of change have begun to blow ... even here amidst the beauty of Heine.<br>
While change often brings with it uncertainty and even anxiety, I sense something indescribable on the wind. Something ominous. Something perhaps even deadly.<br>
I hope these feelings of mine are wrong.<br>
