I have request letters from the two sides in my hand. Both are asking me for my support. After speaking to advocates of each side, which do you think I should support?<br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 237 30969-08a.htm">"You should lend your support to Dr. Helvetica."</a><br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 237 30969-08b.htm">"You should lend your support to Priestess Athenia."</a>
