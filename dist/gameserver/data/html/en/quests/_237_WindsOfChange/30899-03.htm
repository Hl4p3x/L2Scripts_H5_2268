Gatekeeper Flauen:<br>
In the north, a dwarf by the name of <font color="LEVEL">Dr. Helvetica</font> has appeared in the Fields of Silence.
 A more dastardly fellow you will never find.  If the rumors are true, Dr. Helvetica's plan is to conquer that area by force!
 It is said that he plans to lead an army of Enchanted Golems through that area, wiping it clean of friend and foe, so he can transform it into an industrial zone!<br>
In order to stop Helvetica's plans, an elf called Athenia has setup camp on the south end of the island, in the Field of Whispers.
 She is amassing her own following, and means to prevent Dr. Helvetica from getting away with the corruption and desecration of Nature.<br>
But...<br>
