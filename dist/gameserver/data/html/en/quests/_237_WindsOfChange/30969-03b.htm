Iason Heine:<br>
Are you talking about Athenia? Oh yes, I've heard about her.<br>
Not only is she a passionate believer of Eva, but she is also a powerful priestess who knows well about the ancient rites and rituals.
 She believes that the land is something to be nurtured and protected. She would like nothing more than to see this area reinvigorated.<br>
Yes, it's true. I am inclined to help her, for in helping her, I can prevent the spread of these horrible Mucrokians.<br>
