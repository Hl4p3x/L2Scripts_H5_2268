Arujien:<br>
If I tell you her name, you must give me your word that you will not reveal it -- I would sooner die than embarrass her publicly! Well... Her name is <font color="LEVEL">Greenis</font>. Even saying her name aloud makes my heart beat faster!<br>
But I must know if she has feelings for me as well. If she does not, I won't burden her with my love.<br>Will you help me?<br>
