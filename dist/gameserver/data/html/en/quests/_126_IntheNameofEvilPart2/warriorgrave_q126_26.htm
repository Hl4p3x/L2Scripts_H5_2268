Warrior's Grave:<br>
Yes, these are all that remains of my mortal body, summoned forth from their resting place by the power of your Warrior's Song to perform one final duty. <br>
As you take these ashes, accept my spirit! We are now linked, you and I. Take these ashes and go to the end of the <font color="LEVEL">southeast</font> area. It was there that Sailren was supposedly sealed. Examine the area carefully for the seal stone; it should be there as well.<br>
