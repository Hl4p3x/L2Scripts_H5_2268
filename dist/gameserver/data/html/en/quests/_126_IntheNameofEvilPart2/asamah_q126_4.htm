Asamah:<br>
Apparently our ancestors wielded a powerful ax called Gazkh. More than just a weapon, it was a sacred relic granted to our tribe by the goddess Shilen herself. <br>
Gazkh's most important power was the ability to keep the dinosaurs of the Lost Nest sealed within their prison. But somehow the ax's head was shattered, dispersing that power and creating a number of side effects.<br>
