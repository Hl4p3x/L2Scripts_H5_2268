Shilen's Stone Statue:<br>
Oh, is that right? I have sensed the energy emmitted by Sailren had become stronger these later days and wondered if this ancient evil was simply waiting for its chance to strike.<br>
Sadly, the seal stones can no longer completely hold him. I have prayed to Shilen to show me a solution.<br>
Now, with your arrival here, I think our gracious mother has answered our prayers. It may be possible now to defeat it.<br>
