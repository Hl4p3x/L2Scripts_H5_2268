Warrior's Grave:<br>
What you have seen are signs of the Sirens awakening, throwing off the power of the seal! Sirens are filled with wickedness and death, and even have the ability to influence the thoughts and actions of others -- even possess their spirits! It was that ability that led many Elrokian warriors to an ignoble death while I lived.<br>
Unless this awakening is prevented, the entire island will succumb to the Sirens' chaos.<br>
There is no time to waste -- you must listen to me and heed my words. Only you can save my people!<br>
