Shilen's Stone Statue:<br>
I am the seal stone, the gatekeeper set to watch over Sailren.<br>
I am also an avatar of Shilen, who was the mother of this island and the first daughter of Einhasad and Gran Kain.<br>
I ask you, you who are imbued with the spirit of an Elrokian warrior, who you are and why you are here.<br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 126 shilenstatue_q126_2.htm">Tell it about your experience at the warrior's grave and your purpose for coming here.</a>
