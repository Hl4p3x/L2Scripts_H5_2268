I see. Then let me tell you who Shilen once was.<br>
Untold ages ago, the union of the Goddess of Creation,  Einhasad, and the God of Destruction, Gran Kain, produced 5 God-Children. Shilen was first-born, and she grew wiser daily, more courageous, more beautiful and more skilled.<br>
Loved by her subjects, she was the equal of her brothers when it came to commanding an army, an expert in both strategy and tactics.<br>
