Shilen's Stone Statue:<br>
Fool!<br>
In the past, Shilen required her Elrokian warriors to take a sacred oath. Only then did she grant them the ability to wield Gazkh. In Shilen's stead, you must swear the oath to me.<br>
If you refuse, you will never be able to wield Gazkh. Consider carefully! Do you wish to continue? <br>
