Information Broker Grimst:<br>
 Sagittarius's bow was stolen?<br1>
 A few days ago someone was asking about The Bow.<br1>
What? You want me to tell you about him for free?<br1>
 You want me to starve?<br1>
 Hahaha...<br1>
 Well I don't want to get any this time.<br1>
Since you're in the union, it won't cost you money.<br1>
Hmm<br1>
...<br1>
I know. I'm embarrassed to admit it.<br1>
However, I have a crush on Lilly, my partner Mist's granddaughter! I'll tell you more if you find out what Lilly likes and bring it to me!<br1>
 I'll give you a hint: Mist knows everything about Lilly!<br1>
Don't tell him what I said! You shoud find the way by yourself! You'll find them in the hot springs area!
