Tablet of Vision:<br>
You feel a strange, disconnected force enter your body.<br1>
The tablet seems to be communicating with you. You see a vision of a tablet much like this one, protected by several ominous guardians. One of them is holding the next Stone of Commune!<br1>
It appears that they're located in the southern part of the Valley of Saints.<br1>
You feel the Tablet of Vision weakening.
