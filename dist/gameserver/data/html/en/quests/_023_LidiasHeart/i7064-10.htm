Lidia's Diary:<br>
I don't know why I'm here!<br1>
He seems to know every one of my deepest secrets!<br1>
He asked me what I wasn't willing to give up.<br1>
I was honest with him, but I can't remember what I said.<br1>
Whatever it was, I lost it!<br1>
Did that really happen?<br1>
He claims I imagined it all!<br1>
He accuses me of betraying my family, my life, my god and even natural law!<br>
