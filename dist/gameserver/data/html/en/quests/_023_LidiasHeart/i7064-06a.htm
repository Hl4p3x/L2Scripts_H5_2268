Lidia's Diary:<br>
The thirtieth day of the month of Shilen.<br>
Tomorrow's the big day!<br1>
I wasn't able to talk Father out of it.<br1>
Nidrah's words just made too much sense!<br>
The royal authority of Rune has been tenuous for ages, and something must be done!<br1>
Brother Eilhalder said that our family's primary role is to protect Rune itself, not the royal family!<br>
I'm not sure I believe all that...<br>
Nidrah came to me this evening.<br1>
He told me that no matter what I decided, I must always show courage in terrible times.<br1>
What did he mean by that?<br1>
I've always been courageous!<br>
