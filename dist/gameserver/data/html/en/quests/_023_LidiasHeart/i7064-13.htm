Lidia's Diary:<br>
[A different handwriting]<br>
I don't understand!<br1>
Obviously I did it, but without knowing!<br1>
I look in the mirror and her face looks back at me, but there is no mirror!<br1>
Only an image.<br1>
I don't understand any of this!<br1>
Where are my memories?<br1>
They seem to be there, but unaccessible!<br1>
He must have done something to me!<br>
Everything that happens is recorded but forgotten!<br1>
Both regret and satisfaction are the result.<br1>
The Moon Face Flower on your hairpin will seal this Contract.<br>
