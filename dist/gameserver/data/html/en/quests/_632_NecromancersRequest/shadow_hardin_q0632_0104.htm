Mysterious Wizard<br>
The most important of the materials I need are undead hearts with their Human memory intact.<br>
Especially the grey <font color="LEVEL">heart of undead vampires</font>. They're just as good as red cloth from Aden. I need 200 of them.<br>
Also, I'll trade you something for <font color="LEVEL">undead brains</font>. You can hunt them at night. What do you think?
