Grand Magister Valdis:<br>
Well done! We will make great use of the material that you and your clan brought back. What a tremendous feat, to capture and bring back that ferocious creature! As promised, I will spread word everywhere that the clan you lead brought down a <font color="LEVEL">Tyrannosaurus.</font><br>
Could we possibly convince you to continue your efforts on our behalf?<br>
