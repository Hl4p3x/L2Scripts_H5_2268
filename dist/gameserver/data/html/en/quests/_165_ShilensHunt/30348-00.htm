Sentry Nelsya:<br>
In a few weeks, the mass of darkness dedicated to Shillien and Gran Kain will be held. <font color="LEVEL">Shillien's Hunt</font> will be held for ten days before the mass. Unfortunately, those of other races, like yourself, cannot participate in the hunt.
But you may come and watch if you'd like.<br>
