Tablet of Vision:<br>
Countless thoughts beyond comprehension sear painfully into your brain. You hear the faint whisper of a woman's voice.<br1>
A vision appears of a small lizard, trapped in a box. The harder he struggles, the tighter his prison becomes. This is a closed totem.<br1>
Mudaha misrepresented himself to Varanka as Sharuhi Mouth, and received unspeakable powers that are forbidden to Warcryers!<br1>
Alas, the power of the totem eventually grew too strong for Mudaha, and now he struggles just to keep the power in check!<br1>
You can find him inside the maze at the Wall of Argos.<br1>
That Stone of Commune will be the end of him.
