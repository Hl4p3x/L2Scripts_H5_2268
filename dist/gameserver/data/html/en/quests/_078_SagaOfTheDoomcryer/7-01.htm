Tablet of Vision:<br>
As you near the Tablet of Vision, you sense a presence. It has an eternal, primal ferocity. To escape unending torture, the insane totem spirit is striking out blindly at everything around it.<br1>
He was eaten by a vicious creature when he tried to enforce the unenforceable. He seeks a way to remove the extra power since he can not control it.<br1>
Have you read any books about possession? Fierce attacks are coming!<br>
