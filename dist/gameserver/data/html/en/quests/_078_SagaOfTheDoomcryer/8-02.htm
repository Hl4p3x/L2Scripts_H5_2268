Tablet of Vision:<br>
Countless thoughts beyond comprehension sear painfully into your brain. A vision appears of a mysterious dark knight.<br1>
Sharuhi got what was coming to him.<br1>
Prepare for the coming winter! Walk through the snow bravely, leading your comrades to safety!<br1>
What will be there in the end?<br1>
You see a man who walks in the dark, using only one Spidersilk to guide him.<br1>
This is what Seer Skahi was talking about! Tarkai gave him the stone and told him someone was following him. Speak with Seer Skahi.
