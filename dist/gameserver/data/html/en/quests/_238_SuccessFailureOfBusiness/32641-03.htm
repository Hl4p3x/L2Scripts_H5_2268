Alright. If you go near the Purified Ceremony Hall, something called <font color="LEVEL">Brazier of Purity</font> is raised everywhere.<br>
This Magic Square is almost like a symbol for that Purified Ceremony Hall. In addition, that Magic Square disillusions Mucrokians who are interfering in our project, and thus makes them fiercely violent.<br>
Please hurry and get rid of those awful Magic Squares. Bring me <font color="LEVEL">10 Broken Piece of Magic Force</font> as evidence.
