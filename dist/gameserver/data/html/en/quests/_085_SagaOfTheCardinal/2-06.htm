Saint of Light Agnes:<br>
I'll fill the granary with this generous gift. Thanks to your help, these people can walk the path of light once more.<br1>
Now I can help you! A man named* Franz* told me of how one can step beyond his own limitations. You remind me quite a bit of him.<br1>
Take this Stone of Commune to the Tablet of Vision* south of the Tower of Insolence*. It will give you new knowledge.
