Priest Bastian:<br>
Hello! I've been expecting you!<br1>
Don't look so surprised! You're here for the Stone of Commune, aren't you? I got this one from Agnes a while back. Don't you wonder how she got it and why she gave it to me? If you knew her, you'd understand!<br1>
While you were away, there was an accident in Goddard Castle Town. Agnes provided food for the townspeople, and after the accident, everyone, including myself, came to rely upon her.<br1>
The stone you seek isn't perfect. When she gave me this one, she said she needed another, more powerful one.<br>
