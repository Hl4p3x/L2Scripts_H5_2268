Blacksmith Silvery:<br>
Oh, fine, fine!  I see that you are ready for the Artisan test.<br>
It is administered by the guild master of the Black Anvil, of whom you have certainly heard - a blacksmith of great renown! I will give the first, most basic of the tests; if you pass, you may go on to the second test.<br>
Shall we begin?<br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 418 blacksmith_silvery_q0418_06.htm">Take the first part of the test.</a>
