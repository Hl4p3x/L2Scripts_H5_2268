Trader Ariel:<br>
You don't look like you're here to browse.<br>
Is it because you think you're ready to venture into the outside world? Heh ... perhaps you are. Some might disagree with me, but I've come to accept that it's natural for a young elf such as yourself to want more than the protection of the Mother Tree. A part of me is happy, yet a part of me is sad to see you go.<br>
Many different races, including orcs, dwarves and humans make up that place. So it can't help but be very different from this place, where the only ones you'll meet are other elves. Not all the memories you create for yourself will be happy ones. Do you still want to venture to the world outside?<br>
