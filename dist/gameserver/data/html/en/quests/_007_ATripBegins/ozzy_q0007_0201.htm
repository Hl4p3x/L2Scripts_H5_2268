Hierarch Asterios:<br>
I recently received a message from <font color="LEVEL">Ariel</font>. The outside world of the Humans who exiled us here has changed very much, to the point that it is unrecognizable to use Elves, living in isolation. Their world is now one of total chaos!<br>
Far be it for me to deny a young Elf his travels, but I must remind you, there's much to be done here at home. You must prioritize.<br>
Remember your home and the sacred Mother Tree! You must promise to return one day!<br>
