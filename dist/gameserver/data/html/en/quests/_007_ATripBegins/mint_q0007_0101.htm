Gatekeeper Mirabel:<br>
As much as I've traveled, even I can't claim to understand all the peoples in this wide world.<br>
Our Elven Forest is a peaceful haven, but the outside world also has much to offer -- especially a bustling place like Giran.<br>
Only through interacting with outsiders can we better understand not only this world, but ultimately ourselves.<br>
