Detention Camp Warden:<br>
Once there was a major fight between the evil beings and the keepers of this dungeon camp.<br>
What a battle...<br>
Both sides suffered enormous casualties.<br>
But at least the conflict seems to have kept many of the lower level monsters in check.<br>
However, the strongest of the creatures have formed 3 groups and are regularly marauding through the camp.<br>
Judging from their recent activity, they're planning something, that's for sure.<br>
Your task will be to eliminate the <font color="LEVEL">3 groups</font> so that the remaining evil creatures in the camp can be driven out. Kill the General Monster of the <font color="LEVEL">last group</font>, and bring back the <font color="LEVEL">Camp Prisoner Leader's Sign</font>.<br>
In return, I'll give you the Knight's Epaulette, which you can exchange for the fortress clan supply.<br>
Oh, one last thing:<br>
the prisoner leaders we've identified so far are <font color="LEVEL">Brand the Exile, General Koenig and Gerg the Hunter</font>.<br>
I can admit you to the dungeon of the fortress right now.<br>
Please do me this favor!
