Witch Kalis:<br>
Do you really think so? Then, tell those three people who will give their lives on your behalf! Tell them to prove their loyalty to you by risking their lives at the <font color="LEVEL">table of sacrifice next to me</font>! I will say it again.  When they prove their loyalty, they must have made up their minds to sacrifice their lives. I wonder whether among the clan members you will have anybody who has made the firm resolution of standing by you even to death?<br>
If you can bring me <font color="LEVEL">three symbols of loyalty</font>, I will give recognition to the resolution of you and your clan members!
