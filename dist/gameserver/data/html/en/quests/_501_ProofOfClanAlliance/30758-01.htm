Witch Athrea:<br>
I have the <font color="LEVEL">Blood of Eva</font>. However, I cannot give such a precious potion to just anybody who asks for it...  More over, my older sister Kalis asked me specifically... not to give out the Blood of Eva to just anyone who asks for it...<br>
If you would like to obtain the Blood of Eva, you have to pass the test I pose to you.  So...<br>
