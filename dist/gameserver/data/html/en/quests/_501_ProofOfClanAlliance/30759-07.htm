Witch Kalis:<br>
What do you think? How do you like the taste of the poison? What? Everything seems to be growing dark in front of your eyes? That is because death is gradually coming to you… Unless your clan members hurry up, we will have to add another grave here… Will they be able to find and bring back all the ingredients in time?<br>
What a sight to see your face filled with pain Since I feel sorry for you, why don't I give you some hints? Herb of Vanor can be obtained from <font color="LEVEL">vanor Silenos</font>. Herb of Harit can be obtained from <font color="LEVEL">harit lizardmen</font>. And, Herb of Oel Mahum can be obtained from <font color="LEVEL">oel mahums</font>. Rather than warriors, <font color="LEVEL">shamans</font> will have the herbs, wouldn't you agree?<br>
And in order to obtain the Blood of Eva go and ask <font color="LEVEL">Witch Athrea</font>, my younger sister about it. You want to know where you should go to meet her? Well, let's see some time ago, she said she had to go to <font color="LEVEL">Hardin's Academy</font> to meet with Grand Magus Hardin about something.<br>
And, please bear in mind that, <font color="LEVEL">when your clan members bring back all the ingredients, it will have to be you to gather them up. Then come and see me in person. Then I will use the ingredients to make the antidote for you.</font>
