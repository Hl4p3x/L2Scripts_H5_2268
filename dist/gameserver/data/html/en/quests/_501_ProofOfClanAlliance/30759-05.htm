Witch Kalis:<br>
So, where is your confident attitude you exhibited earlier? I guess you haven't been able to find any clan members who are willing to sacrifice their lives?<br>
I am telling you again. Unless you bring me back <font color="LEVEL">three symbols of loyalty</font>, you will not pass the test. And in order to obtain the symbols, three of your clan members will make an oath of their life to the <font color="LEVEL">table of sacrifice</font> and pledge loyalty to you.
