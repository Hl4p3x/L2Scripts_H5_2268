Warehouse Freightman Kluck:<br>
Whew! There's no way I can keep up this pace! Hello, friend! Am I glad to see you!<br>
For as long as anyone can remember, Dwarves have been traders, am I right? And now come the Humans, with their friends in high places, taking over the trade routes in Innadril, Abella, and Giran! Who do they think they are?<br>
Boycott the Humans! We're establishing a free trade zone near Alligator Island! The only problem is, that place is crawling with horrible monsters.<br>
Would you help us get rid of them? If you'd like, we can draw up a contract right now!<br>
