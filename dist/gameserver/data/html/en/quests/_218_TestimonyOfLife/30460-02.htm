Master Cardien:<br>
Soon we will have to face a great difficulty which our future depends on. The <font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree</font>... is dying... We must, even at the cost of any sacrifice, protect the <font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree</font>.<br>
To overcome this hardship, <font color="LEVEL">Hierarch Asterios</font> is calling for the young Elves to gather in the <font color="LEVEL">Elven Forest</font>. You must also return to your homeland. But not yet. You are still... Unprepared. You still need to have more experience.<br>
(Quest for Elven characters level 37 and above.)
