Master Cardien:<br>
When you overcome this difficulty and come back to me as a more mature person, I will acknowledge that you are ready to for higher education and thereby offer you the <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Life</font>.<br>
More than any time, we need to respect mother nature with our hearts, appreciate all living creatures and have sympathy for ourselves. Perhaps just as the very first guardian had sacrificed herself, we might need to sacrifice a lot of things at the cost of overcoming this difficulty.<br>
Right now, <font color="LEVEL">Hierarch Asteros</font> is calling back the young Elves to the <font color="LEVEL">Elven Forest</font>. Your trial has begun. <font color="LEVEL">I will give you this letter, so hurry to see the hierarch in your hometown.</font> May the blessing of the starlights brighten your way.
