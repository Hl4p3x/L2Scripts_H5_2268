Thalia:<br>
At this moment the <font color="LEVEL">Talin's Spear</font> is being transported here from <font color="LEVEL">Innadril</font>. We just have to wait until it arrives.<br>
However it seems to me that you are rather unexperienced to use the power of the spear to its full extent. How about going for a journey of discipline while you have the time. When you feel that you are ready, come back and see me. I suppose that the <font color="LEVEL">Talin's Spear</font> will be here then, as well.
