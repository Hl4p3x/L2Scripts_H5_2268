Hierarch Asterios:<br>
In the past, the first guardian sacrificed herself to give life to the <font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree</font>. But now there are fewer Elves than ever... We can't push someone to sacrifice themself either since we can't afford to lose anyone. And most of all, I shall not see something so painful ever again in my life.<br>
Fortunately, there is another way to bring back life to the <font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree</font>. It is the <font color="LEVEL">Water of Life</font> mentioned in the world-creation legend by the Giants... The legendary water which flowed out from the holy fountain of Eva and gave birth to the first living thing in the beginning of times...<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">Water of Life</font> has been flowing along all rivers and streams since then and gave life to earth. But ever since the great flood inundated the land it has been contaminated. And since then, we haven't been able to see the <font color="LEVEL">Water of Life</font>. At least we believed so... For the past thousands of years... <br>
We did not know before, but we can still find the <font color="LEVEL">Water of Life</font>. The tears in the eyes of the purest being, that is the <font color="LEVEL">Water of Life</font>. Think over what I said just now.<br>
