Priest Adonius:<br>
Thank you very much, brother of forest. Then I shall tell you what you can help us with. Right now, we are short of ink and pens which are used for making the copies.<br>
To make the ink, we need the <font color="LEVEL">Spider Ichor</font>. You can extract them from the <font color="LEVEL">spiders of Cruma Marshlands</font> . And for the pens we need the <font color="LEVEL">Harpy's Down</font>. I would be grateful if you could bring <font color="LEVEL">20 of them, each</font> . If you bring me all of these, I shall give you a copy of the book in return.
