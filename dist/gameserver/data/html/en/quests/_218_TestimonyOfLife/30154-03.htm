Hierarch Asterios:<br>
Of course the Humans are witty and sometimes can be very brave. But at the same time they are ignorant and greedy. For sure, they will open a new future but we Elves must always watch out for the possibility of that future as a dark one...<br>
The reason I called for young <font color="LEVEL">Elves</font> such as you, is because the mother of all <font color="LEVEL">Elves</font>, our <font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree</font> is dying. We should prevent this from happening, at all costs. This is a big trial for all Elves. Are you ready to devote yourself to protecting our <font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree</font>?<br>
