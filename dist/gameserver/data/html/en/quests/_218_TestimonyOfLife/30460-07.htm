Master Cardien:<br>
You have come back. I see that you went through a lot of things even in the short period. I can tell by your eyes... I now see the wisdom and modesty which wasn't there before but I also can't help noticing a sad look in your eyes.<br>
This must be the amulet of chamomile which the hierarch gave you. It contains the message that you have done a great thing for the survival of your tribe and that you are ready for a higher education.<br>
Now I will give you the <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Life</font>. I can guarantee that this will help you in developing your future. Whatever you may face in the future, please, always keep in mind the lessons that the <font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree</font> gave you on beauty and harmony. May the peace of Eva be with you.
