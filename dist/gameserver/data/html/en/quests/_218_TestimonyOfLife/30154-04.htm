Hierarch Asterios:<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree</font> is the origin of life as well as the shelter for the spirits. The rays of heaven shines through the branches and life spreads out though its roots. It is the center of the universe where the sky and earth meet.<br>
The Elves can't live without the <font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree</font>, and neither can the <font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree</font> live without Elves. If the <font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree</font> is the the branch, we are its leaves... In other words, we have had a symbiotic relationship with each other from the very beginning... Even when our body dies, our spirits return to the <font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree</font> and hang around as twinkling lights. By doing so, we participate in its melodies of life even after our deaths.<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree</font>... our origin of life, our shelter for the spirits... is dying.<br>
