Master Cardien:<br>
Everybody's future... Seems cloudy...  It won't be long...<br>
Until the earth covers itself with darkness and the shadows of blood are drawn in the sky... The blackish-red blood will soak the earth...<br>
It will soon begin... The 'Chaotic Chronicle'... <br>
(Quest for Elven characters level 37 and above.)
