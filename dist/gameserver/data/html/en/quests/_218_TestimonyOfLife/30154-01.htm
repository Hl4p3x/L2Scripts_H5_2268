Hierarch Asterios:<br>
Did <font color="LEVEL">Cardien</font> send you here? It seems to me that it was only recently that you ventured from the <font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree</font> to take lessons from me, but look at you now... You have matured so much...<br>
You must be very tired from your journey, I suggest that you drink the clear waters and feel the wind blowing from this beautiful nature and recover your strength.<br>
So, tell me, what have you seen and felt in the kingdom of men?<br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 218 30154_1"> I saw the approaching of their dark future summoned by their ignorance and greed.</a><br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 218 30154_2"> I predict their bright future which their wit and courage will bring forth.</a>
