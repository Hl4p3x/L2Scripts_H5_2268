Thalia:<br>
I have some sad news. <font color="LEVEL">The Talin's Sword has been stolen on its way here!</font> It is said that the lake spirits who were transporting the the spear from <font color="LEVEL">Innadril</font> were attacked by the lizardmen who massacred them and took away the spear.<br>
Hurry! Go and meet <font color="LEVEL">Isael Silvershadow of the Hunter's Village</font>. Help him in dealing with this matter. We must find the <font color="LEVEL">Talin's Sword</font>! Our future lies in it!
