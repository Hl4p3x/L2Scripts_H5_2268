Hierarch Asterios:<br>
Ten years ago, I was really shocked to find out that the <font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree</font> was dying gradually. I have worked hard to find out the reason...<br>
Was it because of the poisonous wind blowing from the <font color="LEVEL">Sea of Spores</font>... Or was it because the rampage that the spirits of nature made the earth energy unstable... And what about the possibility that the Sorcerers of the Dark Elves contaminated the river which the <font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree</font> feeds on?...<br>
I looked into every possibility but could not find out the reason. Perhaps it is the <font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree</font> itself which is dying because it couldn't stand the disappointment of this unjust world...<br>
But we must not lose hope. There must be a way! There must be... A way to revive the dying <font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree</font>... <br>
