Isael Silvershadow:<br>
It was the <font color="LEVEL">leto lizardmen</font> who wrested the spear from the lake fairies. It is said that the Shamans and Chiefs of their group broke the spear into many pieces and divided them among themselves. <font color="LEVEL">The spear was divided into six pieces: the blade, the shaft, and four jewels that adorned the handle... </font>.<br>
These wretched creatures are taking the pieces to the <font color="LEVEL">Immortal Plateau</font> to throw them into the lava cave to destroy the spear forever.  This hostility is not typical of the lizardmen... I am certain that someone is controlling them.<br>
But the most important matter is the recovery of the spear. My brother, I beseech you. Find the <font color="LEVEL">Shamans and Chiefs of the Leto lizardman </font> , and recover all the pieces of the spear that they have taken from us. Time is of the essence. May Sayha of the Winds guide your way...
