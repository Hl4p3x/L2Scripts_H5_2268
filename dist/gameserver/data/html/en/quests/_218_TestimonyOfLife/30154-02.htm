Hierarch Asterios:<br>
Ignorance and greed is not exclusive to Humans. We also should watch out for such faults...<br>
The reason I called for young <font color="LEVEL">Elves</font> such as you, is because the mother of all <font color="LEVEL">Elves</font>, our <font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree</font>, is dying. We should prevent this from happening, at all costs. This is a big trial for all Elves. Are you ready to devote yourself to protecting our <font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree</font>?<br>
