The spear hasn't arrived yet. The bigger problem is that you don't have enough power to use the spear properly. How about going for a journey of discipline while you have the time? When you feel that you are ready, then come back and see me. I suppose that the <font color="LEVEL">Talin's Spear</font> will be here then, as well.
