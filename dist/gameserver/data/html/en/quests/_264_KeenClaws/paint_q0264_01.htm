Trader Payne:<br>
The arrows sold in this store are specially crafted by my hands. As you know, the shaft is made from ash and the tips are made from steel or adamantium.<br>
But sometimes I get orders for custom-made arrows. For example, the <font color="LEVEL">Assassin Kiel Nighthawk</font> has ordered a claw-shaped arrowhead made of wolf claws. He is away at the siege battle in <font color="LEVEL">Giran</font> right now, but I am sure he will order arrowheads again when he returns. I'd like you to help me gather the wolf claws when that time comes.<br>
(Quest for characters level 3 and above.)
