Ah, the new model calculator!  Good job!  You shall be rewarded for this!  Give me a moment while I check it out!<br>
Is this how this works?<br>
Aaargh! Do you actually think that this is a new mofel?<br>
Well, sorry to tell you this, but this calculator can only handle simple equations.  It's of no use to me at all.  I suppose, however, you still should be paid for your efforts.<br>
How does 1,000 adena sound?  Or, if you prefer, you can have the calculator.  It's your choice!<br>
