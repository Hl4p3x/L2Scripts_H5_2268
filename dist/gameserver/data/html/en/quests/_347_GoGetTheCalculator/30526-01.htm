Blacksmith Brunon:<br>
Over the long years of trading, the dwarves have created a tool to help traders with their calculations.  At first it was a very simple device, but over time they were able to make them better and capable of more complex computations.  I find this very useful and I always wish to get the latest model of this <font color="LEVEL">calculator</font>.  Recently a new one was created.  I heard it has been brought to town but I have not seen it yet.  I do not know where to look for it, but I am sure the <font color="LEVEL">Trader Guilds</font> brought it into town.<br>
As you probably already know, there are two trader guilds in this village: the <font color="LEVEL">Silver Scale Guild</font> and the <font color="LEVEL">Golden Wheel Guild</font>.<br>
I do not have the time to go and search for it.  Do you think you can check the leaders and people from these guilds to find me the <font color="LEVEL">newest model calculator</font>?  I will, of course, pay you for your efforts.<br>
