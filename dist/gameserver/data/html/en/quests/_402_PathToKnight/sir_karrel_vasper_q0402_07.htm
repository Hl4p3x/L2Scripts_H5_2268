Sir Karrel Vasper:<br>
Traditionally, the lord of the citizens who received the apprentice knight's help would show gratitude by inviting the apprentice to his castle and throwing a feast. But these days, the tradition is to give a <font color="LEVEL">Coin of Lords.</font> A Coin of Lords is a gold coin engraved with a wise saying, showing the lord's gratitude. The right to give out these coins is given to the village guard captain or high priest.<br>
When the pilgrimage is over and the apprentice knight returns, the number of Coins he has determines whether the apprentice knight will be formally recognized as a full-fledged knight.<br>
If you wish to join the Knight Guild and earn the title of a knight, you must also go through this trial. So, my brother of the sword, will you formally go through the trial of the apprentice knight?<br>
