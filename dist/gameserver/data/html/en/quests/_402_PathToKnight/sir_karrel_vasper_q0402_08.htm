Sir Klaus Vasper:<br>
Very well. I, Sir Klaus Vasper, the guardian knight of the west, bestow this <font color="LEVEL">Trial of the Apprentice Knight</font> upon you. Always carry this mark with you while embarking on the trial. This is how people along your pilgrimage will recognize you as an apprentice knight.<br>
As you go around to the villages in the Gludio region, try to meet with the local <font color="LEVEL">guard captain</font> or the <font color="LEVEL">high priest.</font> They will suggest many difficult tasks that you may perform for the people. When you complete these tasks, you can obtain a Coin of Lords. If you return with <font color="LEVEL">three or more Coins</font>, you will have completed your trial.<br>
Then, embark on your journey. May Einhasad's protection be with you.
