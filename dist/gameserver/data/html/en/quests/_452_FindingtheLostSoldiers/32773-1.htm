Officer Jakan:<br>
Unless you've commanded men in battle, I doubt you could understand my mental state just now. I was forced to abandon most of my soldiers during the crash to save my life and those who near me. It weighs heavily on my heart, which is why I've been making a request to travelers who've come here to help.<br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 452 32773-2.htm">Ask about the request.</a>
