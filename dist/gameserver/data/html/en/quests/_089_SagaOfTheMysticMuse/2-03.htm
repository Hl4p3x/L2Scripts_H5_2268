Thanks for the report. This merits further investigation.<br1>
To become a Mystic Muse, you'll need a Stone of Commune for each of the six stone tablets. Use the stones to commune with the tablets and your path will become clear.<br1>
Here's the first Stone of Commune, take it to the Tablet of Vision.<br>
