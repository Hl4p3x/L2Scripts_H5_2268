Lastly, I thank you for preventing the disaster. I assume Doctor Pavel is also grateful to you. Doctor Chaos remains, but you will not need my power to deal with him. If adventurers such as yourselves combine your efforts, you will be strong enough to fight against even more formidable enemies, like the Children of Shilen.<br>
