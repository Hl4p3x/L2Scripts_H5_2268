<center>A message from Atlanta</center><br>
[Wendy speaks in a deep voice which is obviously not hers.]<br>
My little friend... I thank you for your help. Thanks to you, I am now able to join my friends in a time and place far away, finally freed from my worries. When I look back, it all seems so strange... the great Spire of Arbiterre, the life-changing Mimir's Elixir, the sky-changing study of Pavel... I learned many things from you, my little friend, about the present times and the true strength and the wisdom of a leader. Most important of all, you taught me that the Age of the Giants has truly passed. The skills of the Giants are no longer needed in these times.<br>
