All I know is that Dr. Chaos operated some kind of device. According to my memory, the device was meant <font color="LEVEL">to control the weather</font> around Pavel. When the sleeping system awoke, its first act was to activate this device. I think perhaps the last mode in which it operated was <font color="LEVEL">N-45: Arrival of Eternal Spring.</font><br>
