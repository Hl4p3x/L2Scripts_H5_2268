Listen closely, for this pertains to Dr. Chaos.*From time to time, he comes here.* <font color="LEVEL">If you attempt to speak with him, though, he will treat you as an enemy and dispatch a Gigantic Chaos Golem to rend the flesh from your bones.</font> If you can defeat him here, it will certainly keep him from causing any trouble for a while.
