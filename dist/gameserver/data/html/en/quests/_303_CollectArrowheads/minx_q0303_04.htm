Master Minia:<br>
There are many Orcs on Talking Island, but the Tunath Orcs are at the <font color="LEVEL">Elven Ruins</font>. There you will be able to find arrowheads used by the Tunath Orc Marksmen. If you don't know how to find the ruins, ask Guard Kenyos.<br>
These would not be soley for my own private collection. I plan to donate some to Sedrick's Training Hall for exhibition, so please bring back ten arrowheads.
