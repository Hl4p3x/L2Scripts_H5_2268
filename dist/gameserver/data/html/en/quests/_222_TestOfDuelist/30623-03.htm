Duelist Kaien:<br>
Greetings, young warrior. My name is Kaien and I am a 'duelist' belonging from the arena at Shutguart. My quest is to travel the continent to discover talented swordsmen and train them as duelists.<br>
Though the kingdoms of Elmore and Aden are hostile to one another, that does not influence the affairs of a guild... My wish is to train as many duelists as possible and pass on the splendid tradition of swordsmanship of the Warrior Guild on this continent...<br>
