Warehouse Keeper Rolfe:<br>
Ho, that's some nice yarn you've got there. Keltir fur? I can tell at a single glance. Right now, I am stationed here and managing the warehouse because of my guild work, but my main trade is as a tailor. The most affluent merchants in all of Giran were my clients ... ahem.<br>
Huh? What? The doll that <font color="LEVEL">Rockswell</font> wanted? Ah, yes! It must have slipped my mind. I must make the doll's hair from the yarn you have brought me. Wait just a moment. I'll be done soon.<br>
Wonderful! All done. A beautiful maiden doll with orange hair. Wait, did <font color="LEVEL">Rockswell</font> have a granddaughter?
