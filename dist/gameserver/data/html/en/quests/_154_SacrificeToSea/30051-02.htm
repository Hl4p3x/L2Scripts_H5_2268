Ah, you've been sent by <font color="LEVEL">Rockswell</font>. Such fine, soft fur. I think we have plenty here. Please wait a moment, I will spin you that yarn right now.<br>

Ah, and please tell Mr. <font color="LEVEL">Rockswell</font> that I am knitting a woolen coat for him to wear this winter. It must be hard for him to weather the cold sea winds and guard the lighthouse all alone. Tsk tsk.
