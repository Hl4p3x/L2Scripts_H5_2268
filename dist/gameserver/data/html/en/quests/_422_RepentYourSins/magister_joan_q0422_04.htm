Magister Joan:<br>
Ah, it's you again! I'm so dreadfully sorry about the confusion last time. Yes, about your pay... I apologize, I'm waiting for approval and a check from the home office...<br1>
...err, ummm...<br1>
To tell you the truth, I hired you without the approval of the Grand Magisters of Ivory Tower! You may be waiting a very, very, very long time for your compensation. Please forgive me! I am so ashamed of myself... I'm always getting into trouble. I'm also stubborn! And obsessive-conpulsive! Is that a bad thing?<br1>
...By the way, who in the world are you?
