Black Judge:<br>
This is the first time that *Wiseman Casian*<br1>
has ever met with a black judge. He has volunteered to walk the path of endless hardship.<br1>
Right now he is working on a task in <font color="LEVEL">the southern Wasteland in Gludio</font>.<br1>
He is in trouble and needs some help... Go there and find him. Come back and see us when you have completed the task.<br>
(This quest is automatically stopped if any sub-class is added or changed while it is performed.)
