Warehouse Keeper Walderal:<br>
Are you OK? How did you forget so quickly? OK, once more. Listen carefully. Bring to me the blueprints of the Tower of Insolence. There are 13 of them.
 
Take from <font color="LEVEL">Corrupt Sages, Erin Ediunces, Hallate's Inspectors, Platinum tribe overlords, Platinum Guardian Prefects and Messenger Angels.</font> You can keep anything else you find on them. All i want are the blueprints...<br>
Bring me all of them and I'll give you a recipe for a pair of gloves, shoes or a hat. Is that clear? Now, please, get going.<br>
