Magister Errickin:<br>
How much are you willing to pay?<br>
Hmm, you must be here on the orders of another..<br>
No matter, In order to obtain Stabilized Ectoplasm, which is itself a rare item.<br>
In fact, I have need of it as well..<br>
You have the look of an adventurer, so I will strike a bargain with you.<br>
Exterminate <font color="LEVEL">the Mirror Ghost</font> and <font color="LEVEL">the Mummy</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Forest of Mirrors</font> and you will be able to acquire <font color="LEVEL">ectoplasms</font>.<br>
Thirty ectoplasms will produce one Stabilized Ectoplasm. Bring back <font color="LEVEL">35</font> of the and give me 5. Then I will make you a Stabilized Ectoplasm using this remainder.
