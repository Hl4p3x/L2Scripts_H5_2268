Hardin:<br>
(Hardin draws something and begins writing in the empty Book of Seal. Once finished, he casts some sort of spell on the Book of Sealm which flashes for a moment.)<br>
Now take this Book of Seal to <font color="LEVEL">Avant-Garde, the Transformation Wizard</font> on the 2nd floor of the <font color="LEVEL">Ivory Tower</font> and you should be able to effect a transformation.<br>
My thanks - you are a valuable assistant!<br>
Since I'm as generous as I'm brilliant, I also wish you to take this...<br>
Now I can plunge myself into research for a more varied kind of Transformation magic.<br>
Farewell!
