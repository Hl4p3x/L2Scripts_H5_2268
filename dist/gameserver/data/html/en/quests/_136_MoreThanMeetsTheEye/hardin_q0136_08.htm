Hardin:<br>
Ha! An adventurer after my own heart... Don't try to satisfy your curiosity in ome guip, though.<br>
If we make progress with these experiments, I'm sure all of your questions will be answered.<br>
At this stage in my research, I absolutely require <font color="LEVEL">Stabilized Ectoplasm</font>.<br>
I have learned that it can be obtained from <font color="LEVEL">Dark Elf Magister Errickin in Hunters Village</font>, but I cannot leave my experiment at the moment.<br>
Will you go in my place, obtain it and bring it back here?
