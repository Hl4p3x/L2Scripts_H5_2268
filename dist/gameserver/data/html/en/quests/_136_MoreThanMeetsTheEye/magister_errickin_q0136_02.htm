Magister Errickin:<br>
Wait..did you say that you have come for Stabilized Ectoplasm?<br>
There aren't not many magicians these days who deal with ectoplasm, which is composed of filthy and unpleasant souls..<br>
Fortunately for you, I am one of them.<br>
Ah, you undoubtedly will not wish to divulge to me yout purpose for this ectoplasm..<br>
Well, I don't know what kind of necromantic magic you are experimenting with, but it must be a challenging task.<br>
