Hardin:<br>
I see that you have brought the empty Book of Seal. With this, all our preparations are completed!<br>
While you were gone, I made an infusion using the Stabilized Ectoplasm and Mimir's Elixir.<br>
Drink this and yur soul should be able to endure the transformation process.<br>
Not nervous, are you? I suppose that technically you are the first to attempt this, but I'm entirely confident in my theory, and you seem a hardy, healthy specimen.<br>
