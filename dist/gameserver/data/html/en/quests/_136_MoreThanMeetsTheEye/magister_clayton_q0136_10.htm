Oh, this is.. I don't know your purpose, but it looks as though you are seeking a new type of spell medium..<br>
Ard a very powerful one at that..<br>
It will be difficult, but I believe I can create it according to these specifications.<br>
Unfortunately, I'm missing a key ingredient.<br>
Apparently, in order to create it, I will require <font color="LEVEL">5 Glass Jaguar Crystals</font>.<br>
Interesting.. You see, I'm also keenly interested in new magic.<br>
I will make you a deal. If you bring back 5 Glass Jaguar Crystals, I'll create an empty Book of Seal set for you at no cost.<br>
In case you were unaware of it, Glass Jaguar is a malignant spirit in the shape of a leopard that guards <font color="LEVEL">Plains of Dion</font>.
