The ability to change the soul and then restore it to it's original state is an essential condition for transformation magic.<br>
If the soul perishes after transformation, or if the subject cannot be returned to it's original state, the power is worthless.<br>
Needless to say, this posed an extremely difficult problem even for my intellect, but I was able to use Mimir's Elixir and principles of Necromancy to solve it.<br>
Still, the process hasn't been perfected...<br>
I'm now experimenting with a method that I believe may provide that last key.<br>
By using Mimir's Elixir and the Stabilized Ectoplasm that you brought me, I'm reasonably certain that I can allow your soul to endure the transformation process.<br>
Once in that state of transformtion, you should be able to use the Seal of Transformation to further transform at will.<br>
