My, my! Hatchlings are very popular this season! I will tell you what I can about them. When they grow larger they are called striders and may be ridden. Later they mature into flying creatures called wyverns.<br>
Take a look at this Katz. It's so cute and cuddly it's hard to imagine that they become such huge creatures! Ha Ha...<br>
What is your interest in hatchlings? Would you like to raise one?<br>
