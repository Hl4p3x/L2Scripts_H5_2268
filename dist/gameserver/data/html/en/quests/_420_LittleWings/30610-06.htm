Elder Cronos:<br>
Oh well, what do I have to lose? Here is the list of ingredients you will need in order to create a <font color="LEVEL">Deluxe Fairy Stone</font>. Howover this cannot be accomplished easily, not even by a skilled Dwarven Artisan. I do know of a young lady named <font color="LEVEL">Maria who lives in Dion Castle Town</font> who can make a Crystal of Purity. I think she may also be able to make a <font color="LEVEL">Deluxe Fairy Stone</font>... If she can't help you I am afraid you may be out of luck. But you won't know until you ask, eh? By the way, among the ingredients, the <font color="LEVEL">Toad Lord's Back Skin</font> cannot be purchased. You must go to the <font color="LEVEL">Cruma Marshlands</font> yourself and kill a <font color="LEVEL">Toad Lord</font> to collect it.
