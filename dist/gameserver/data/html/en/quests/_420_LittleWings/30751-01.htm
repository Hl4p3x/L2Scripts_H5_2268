Wyvern Suzet:<br>
I am a cold-hearted beast. Is this the Juice of Monkshood? I suppose Fairy Mymyu told you that in order to straighten out a dull-witted wyvern, you would have to pour this poison into my mouth? Poppycock! You should throw away such dangerous stuff.<br>
If you have been sent by Mymyu, I suppose you are the one who will find my lost eggs. I guess you want a reward for your work, right? What is your wish? I will try to meet your expectations as much as possible.<br>
