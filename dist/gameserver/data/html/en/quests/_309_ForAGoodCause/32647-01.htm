Apprentice Atra:<br>
Those Dwarves, they only have hammer and chisel in their brain. And sometimes I think that Dr. Helvetica is the worst one of the bunch! If he is allowed to be successful, he will bring calamity and devastation to this land.<br>
Athenia leads a group of people devoted to stopping the good doctor's plans. And now that I know you have been accepted as one of us, I have a mission for you and you alone.<br>
