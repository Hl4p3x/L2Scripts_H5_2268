Hunters Guild Member Grey:<br>
You must bring the skin of the <font color="LEVEL">Windsus Aleph</font>. It is a particularly strong and vicious black boar, native to the Giran region. To find him you must go to the <font color="LEVEL">Death Pass</font> and hunt windsuses, eventually you will come across the Windsus Aleph. Your arrow must fly the moment you see its face!<br>
