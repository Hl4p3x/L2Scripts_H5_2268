Hunters Guild Member Grey:<br>
We get dozens of hunting requests every day. You should speak to <font color="LEVEL">Guild Member Tor</font> to find out what requests have currently come in. If there is a job that you like, you can accept it.<br>
There is also the possibility of being hired by individuals. Recently <font color="LEVEL">Cybellin</font> asked me to introduce him to a trustworthy hunter. Would you care to meet him?<br>
