Good thinking. Go to Mimir's Forest and catch the <font color="LEVEL">Muertos</font>. Of course, the important thing is to bring back the <font color="LEVEL">Muertos Feathers</font> from their wings. Odd, isn't it, that such beautiful feathers grow on the bodies of such dangerous monsters? Still, collectors from the continent are very anxinous to get their hands on these feathers.<br>
I don't know exactly how much they're wiling to pay, but I'm sure it will be a steep price. Of course, I will pay you well for the feathers as well, so collect as many as possible.
