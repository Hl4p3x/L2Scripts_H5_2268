Trader Ladd:<br>
You have shown your many skills, you have made your friends and allies... you have fought with might and conquered many enemies. Do you think that's enough? There is still knowledge far beyond your capabilities. Have you ever imagined the power one could have, if he could be master not only one occupation, but many!<br>
Well, your mind is limitted now.  But if you wish, I can teach you how to open your body and mind to new possibilities! However, once you start, there is no way back. What say you?<br>
