Trader Ladd:<br>
Did you make any Pure Silver yet? No? What are you waiting for? You didn't change your mind, did you?<br>
Go and talk to <font color="LEVEL">Magic Trader Wesley</font>. He will teach you what you need to know to create pure silver.  Remember, the ingredients you need in order to make it are lunargent and quicksilver. Come back to me after you have aquired one.
