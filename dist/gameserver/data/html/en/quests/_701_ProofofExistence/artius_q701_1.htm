War Mage Artius<br>
I'm responsible for keeping the perimeter of the Alliance base safe, which I do by fire magic. Because of care about the great fire, I don't have the time to drive out the <font color="LEVEL">Undead</font> that are recently haunting the area around the base.<br>
You can help me out by destroying the Undead infesting the airspace <font color="LEVEL">above the Seed of Infinity</font>. Moreover, I would very much appreciate it if you could kill <font color="LEVEL">Banshee Queen Enira</font>, the leader of the Undead.<br>
What you say, will you take my errand?<br>
