This seems to be the <font color="LEVEL">Big Yellow Treasure Chest</font>
 that my client lost! When I opened it, it contained a letter addressed to Miss Kiki.
 The Dwarves must've really hated to lose this one! They're always bragging that they've never lost an item!
 Take this chest to Mineral Trader Kiki.
