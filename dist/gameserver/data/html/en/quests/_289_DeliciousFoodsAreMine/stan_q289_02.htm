Guard Stan:<br>
Know what? No soup for them! I eat the soup because I protect the village, I need that deliciousness in my belly to keep strong and sharp.<br>
We need to keep the Sel Mahum from using the power of the soup. I sure could use your help with that. Will you answer the call to defend my soup?<br>
