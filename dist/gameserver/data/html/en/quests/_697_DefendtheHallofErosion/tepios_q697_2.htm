Officer Tepios:<br>
Then I will tell you about your mission.<br>
You must enter the Hall of Erosion, which consists of a circular passage connecting 8 rooms. In 4 of the rooms you will encounter something called <font color="LEVEL">Unstable Seed of Life</font>. It protects the area from the undead.<br>
Naturally, the undead wish to destroy this Unstable Seed of Life in order to occupy this area permanently. Your mission is to protect it for the time specified.<br>
You can prevent their attack from intensifying by <font color="LEVEL">keeping the destroyed tumors in the other 4 rooms in a deactivated condition</font>. Do you understand?<br>
