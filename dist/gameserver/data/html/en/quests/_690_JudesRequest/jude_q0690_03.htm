Jude:<br>
Bear in mind that what I'm looking for are not run-of-the-mill weapons carried by common monsters within the Steel Citadel. No, I need weapons from the Lesser Evils and Greater Evils that are found in <font color="LEVEL">Monster Foundry</font>. Other Evil Weapons are useless! Understand?<br>
Bring me <font color="LEVEL">200 Evil Weapons</font> and I'll give you the <font color="LEVEL">S80 Grade weapon recipe</font> in exchange. Or I can give you <font color="LEVEL">3 S80 Grade weapon pieces</font> for every <font color="LEVEL">5 Evil Weapons</font> you bring me.
