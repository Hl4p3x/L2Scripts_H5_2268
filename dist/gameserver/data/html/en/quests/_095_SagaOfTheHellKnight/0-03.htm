Dark Knight Mordred:<br>
Will you find Waldstein for us?<br1>
As I said, Waldstein's been seen near the Tablet of Vision recently. He's probably paying homage to it...* Join the pilgrims of the Tablet of Vision so you can follow Waldstein. Find out what he's up to.*<br1>
Speak with* Guard Bayard of Goddard Castle Town*. He'll tell you what you need to do next. You should take a copy of the guild bulletin with you!
