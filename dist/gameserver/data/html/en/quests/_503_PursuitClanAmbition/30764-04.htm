Balthazar:<br>
I've heard about you from Sir Athebaldt. He was saying that your clan would help me in my research. So you're wanting to know what I'm researching? Alright, I'll tell you! I've got a friend named Tajif Goldgedder who I've known for dozens of years. That guy recently brought some curious materials from Cruma Tower. I'll leave out the details, but we are currently engaged in research on siege golems that are strong enough to break through even strong castle walls in one shot. If we can just get this working, the methods of war will be changed completely.<br>
