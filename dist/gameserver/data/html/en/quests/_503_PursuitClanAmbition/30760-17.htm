Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:<br>
You have to find the <font color="LEVEL">'Scepter of Judgment'</font> that everybody is trying to get a hold of. Before other forces snatch the relic, we should make it our possession.  Please hurry up and go see <font color="LEVEL">Sir Eric Rodemai in Aden Castle Town</font>. Give him the letter I gave you. Then he will tell you what you need to do.
