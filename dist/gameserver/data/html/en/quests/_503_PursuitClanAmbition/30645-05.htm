Did you just say that all the Master Raiders died?! ...Oh, my!<br>
That's too bad but what can be done about it?... I mean, they were guys that lived by grave robbing and making their living off deeds like smuggling relics from the past... Doing that kind of work is always dangerous and they must have been prepared for something like this to happen someday.<br>
Anyway, you've done a really good job. I'll go ahead and take all the eggs that you've brought. Now, why don't you go back to Atebalt and give him your report?<br>
