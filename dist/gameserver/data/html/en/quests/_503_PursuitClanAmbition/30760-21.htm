Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:<br>
From looking at your face, I can tell that you heard something about me from Sir Rodemai... Please don't misunderstand me. When King Rauhel was alive, I gave my full devotion to him.  And when I expressed to you my concern over this country, I was at least halfway truthful... However, I think that if I become a king, I will be able to solve the problem this country is facing more quickly. You can say that it is my ambition and aspiration. You want to hear about that old and broken Scepter of Judgment? Humph.  All the stories about the scepter are of course superstitions. However the stupid people and soldiers believe them. By having the scepter, I can boost the morale of our soldiers and make our enemy afraid of us! Thereby, I can establish an invincible army...  How about you?  I did take advantage of your clan for this purpose.<br>
But isn't it true that you also used me for your own aspiration? From now on, you will often seek my help and receive it.  Yes it's also true that someday, we may follow different paths and end up facing each other as enemies.  However, right at this moment, what is it that you need the most?<br>
Here, look!  I am holding it in my hand...   the <font color="LEVEL">Proof of Aspiration</font>. We are exchanging the things we need from each other. This is a wholesome trade...  Heh Heh Heh<br>
