Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:<br>
I already received the report from Martien.  I gave a little bit of money to the families of the dead dwarves as a token of condolence.  It is a shame... although they were just hired dwarves, they lost their lives while working for me. This is truly sad and regrettable.<br>
Any how, with this, we have come to the end of the first stage of our plans... Now I have something else that I would like you to work on.<br>
