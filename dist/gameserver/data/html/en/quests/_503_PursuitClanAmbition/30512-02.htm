Head Blacksmith Kusto:<br>
Magpie brooch...? This...?! How could Kurtz...!<br>
Boo, hoo..! It's from the Magpie Brothers! He really was going around with those ill-bred guys and ended up like this...He drug the respectable title of Master Raider through the mud... What an unfortunate fellow...!<br>
But even though he disgraced himself, still can't ignore the blood connection. Thank you for bringing me this from my dead brother. As thanks, I'd like you to take these <font color="LEVEL">coins</font>. This is an expression of gratitude from the Black Anvil Guild.<br>
