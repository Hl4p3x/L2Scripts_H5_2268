Balthazar:<br>
As I've already said, we need <font color="LEVEL">10 Titan Powerstones and 10 Nebulite Crystals.</font> The powerstones can be taken from the mechanical devices attached to the bodies of <font color="LEVEL">Titan Soldiers and Border Guards</font> that you kill. Go get some that aren't broken!  And the nebulite crystals can also be gotten from the titans. They look like gemstones that shine brightly but... you'll be able to recognize them easily because of the special luster they emit.
