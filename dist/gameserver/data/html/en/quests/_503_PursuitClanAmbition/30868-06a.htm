Sir Eric Rodemai:<br>
Let me see... If I roughly put them together...<br>
<font color="LEVEL">...  The place must be the National Cemetery...</font><br>
<font color="LEVEL">If you trounce the grave keeper, a key master will show up.  Get a key from him </font><br>
<font color="LEVEL">And when you collect all six keys, overpower the imperial grave keeper to find the scepter</font>.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">However, they said that the imperial keeper can freely move through "time and space"... This must mean that is able to move very fast or make instant movements...  And the meaning of pierce with two pronged lance means..." to divide your team into two parts to attack him... maybe?</font>
