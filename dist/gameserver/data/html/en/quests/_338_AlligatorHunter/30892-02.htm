Wonderful! You should be honored! I don't ask just anyone to be my partner, but I like the cut of your jib!<br>
Now, let me explain how this is done. You must go to <font color="LEVEL">Alligator Island</font> and kill as many <font color="LEVEL">alligators</font> as you can. Bring their <font color="LEVEL">pelts</font> back to me; I'll pay you 40 adena for each one.
