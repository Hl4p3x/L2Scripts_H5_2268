Khavatari Rosheek:<br>
Have you come back already? I was about to rest, but you've disturbed me. Don't be such a nuisance, go and kill the <font color="LEVEL">scarlet salamander</font> with your bare hands and bring back the scales! Collect <font color="LEVEL">five scales</font> in this pouch and bring them to me.
