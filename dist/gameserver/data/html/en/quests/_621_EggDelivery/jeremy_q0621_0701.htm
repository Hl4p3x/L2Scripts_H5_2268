Excellent!<br>
You seem to have more aptitude for delivery work than I thought. You did a good job, but unfortunately, I don't have the adena to pay you. I don't have any more work for you, either... Talk to <font color="LEVEL">Brewer Valentine</font> in the Town of Goddard. He owes me, and he'll give you a satisfactory reward.
