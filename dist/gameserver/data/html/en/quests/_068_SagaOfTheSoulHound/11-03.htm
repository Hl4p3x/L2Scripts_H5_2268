Berka:<br>
Aye, how time does fly! You have come for my Resonance Amulet, I suspect.<br1>
My apologies for my bad manners just now; I was under attack when you appeared, and I assumed you were simply another enemy.<br1>
My friend, I regret that you have come all this way -- I cannot give you this Resonance Amulet! I am also on the same path as you, you see, and I need it as well.<br1>
I can tell you, however, how to get one for yourself.<br1>
That would also be good training for you, wouldn't it? The Resonance Amulet you need is in the hands of the Archon of Halisha.<br1>
He can be found at the Imperial Tomb, but I have also heard that he will appear if his followers on the northern side of the Wall of Argos are attacked.<br1>
Whichever you choose, defeat him and the Amulet will be yours!
