Hierarch Kekropus:<br>
When we Kamael were revealed to the world, it was agreed that that power would remain sealed.
Unless... should one of our own prove worthy to wield it, it would be permitted.<br1>
If you are that person, you will be able to unbind the seals and obtain the power you seek. I
can only show you the way, however; the rest depends on your strength and character. If you
succeed, I will wish to speak with you again about the destiny you have embraced. Would you
like to try to unbind the seals?<br>
