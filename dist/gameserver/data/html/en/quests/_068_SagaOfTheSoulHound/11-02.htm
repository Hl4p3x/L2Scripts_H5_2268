Berka:<br>
To get the Resonance Amulet, there are two ways.<br1>
One way is to defeat the <font color="LEVEL">Archon of Halisha,</font> who is located within *the Four Sepulchers.*<br1>
You must form a party to enter.<br1>
If that proves too difficult, defeat the followers of Halisha at the <font color="LEVEL">Shrine of Loyalty.</font> By doing so, you can earn "tickets." Once you have acquired over <font color="LEVEL">700</font> tickets, Halisha himself will appear. By the way, the creatures you must face are the <font color="LEVEL">Grave Scarab, Scavenger Scarab, Grave Ant, Scavenger Ant, Shrine Knight and Stander.</font>
