Hierarch Kekropus:<br>
Since we were created by the Giants, not the gods, we stand outside the natural order of things as established by the gods.
Although individually our powers do not compare to those of the gods, we can nevertheless harm them -- just as a poisoned needle can
slay the mightiest beast. But is that the totality of our purpose? Were we simply manufactured as living weapons?<br1>
