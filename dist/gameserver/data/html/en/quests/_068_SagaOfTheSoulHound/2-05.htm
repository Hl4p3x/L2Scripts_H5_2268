Warehouse Chief Mona:<br>
I think I lost the key...<br1>
We can't break into the safe, either. We have no choice -- you must go to Head Blacksmith Noel
in the Town of Goddard and tell him that I need an extra key, and he will be able to give it
to you. Simple, right?<br1>
You'd best get going then!
