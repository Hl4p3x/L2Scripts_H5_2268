When a being's thought or spirit energy comes together into the shape of a bead, we call that a Spirit Bead. Artisans like me need them to make good weapons. That's why we gamble with them -- as they're worth a lot to us. In this area, the say that you can easily get Spirit Beads if you go to <font color="LEVEL">Aden Cemetery, The Ancient Battlegrounds</font> and <font color="LEVEL">the Fields of Massacre</font>.<br>
First, at <font color="LEVEL">The Cemetery</font>, you can obtain <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Beads</font> from undead creatures known as the <font color="LEVEL">Spiteful Ghost of Ruins, Soldier of Grief, Cruel Punisher, Roving Soul, Tortured Undead</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Wasted Soul</font>.<br>
Second, at <font color="LEVEL">the Ancient Battlegrounds</font>, you can obtain <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Beads</font> from undead creatures known as <font color="LEVEL">Past Knight,Ghostly Warrior, Hungered Corpse, the Dark Guard, Death Agent</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Nihil Invader</font> and form the demons known as <font color="LEVEL">Bloody Lord, Bloody Priest, Bloody Knight</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Bloody Ghost</font>.<br>
Lastly, at the <font color="LEVEL">Fileds of Massacre</font>, you can obtain <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Beads</font> from undead creatures known as <font color="LEVEL">Doom Scout, Doom Servant, Doom Guard, Doom Archer, Doom Trooper, Doom Warrior, Doom Knight, Wretched Archer, Spiteful Soul Leader, Spiteful Soul Wizard</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Spiteful Soul Fighter</font>.<br>
I think that's enough information for you to get started. Is there anything else you'd like to know?<br>
