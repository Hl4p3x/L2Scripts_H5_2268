Blacksmith Wilbert:<br>
From time to time, we enjoy a duel game called <font color="LEVEL">The Battle of Sun and Moon</font>. It's pretty popular in these parts, in case you haven't heard of it. I've found it a great way to pass the time when you're between jobs. Just say the word and I'll teach you everything you need to know.<br>
What do you say?<br>
