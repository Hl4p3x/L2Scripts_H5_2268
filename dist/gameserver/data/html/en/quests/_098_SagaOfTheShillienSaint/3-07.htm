Magister Kamilen:<br>
Saint Agnes spoke of* the Divine Stone of Wisdom, a fragment of the Stone of Commune*. Go to* the Ketra Orcs or the Varka Silenos* to get it.<br1>
They know of its powerful magic, but not its exact use. They'll reward the wisest of their tribe with it. You'll have to earn the trust of Asefa, chief shaman of the Ketra Orcs, or Udan Mardui, chief shaman of the Varka Silenos. Bring it here, and I'll make it whole again.<br1>
Which side will you choose?<br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 98 3-6">The Ketra Orcs</a><br1>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 98 3-7">The Varka Silenos</a>
