Chef Duncan:<br>
What can I do for you, priest?<br1>
Saint Agnes sent you to me? Well come on in, then! How are things with Saint Agnes?<br1>
Ah, yes, the starving people! She has a heart of gold, that one! I'll always do anything I can to help her. I'm glad you came!<br1>
I'll need something to keep the food fresh on the trip back to her, however...<br>
