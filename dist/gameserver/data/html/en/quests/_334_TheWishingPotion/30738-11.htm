Ah, you there! Do you remember? You made a promise to me... What's the reason this time...? Are you wanting to take the wish potion? Or are you getting together the ingredients to make more wish potion?<br>

<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 334 30738-06.htm">Say that you'll get the ingredients.</a>
