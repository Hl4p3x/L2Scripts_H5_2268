Musician Nanarin:<br>
I must  admit  that  his  broad  shoulders  take my breath  away, and  that lovely  beard  of  his  captured  my  soul :<br>
What can  I do? I've  never  felt this way  before:  Could you please  help me?  <br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 363 30956_2.htm">"I will help you."</a> <br>
Could you  perhaps find  out what would make  him happy? I love Barbado:  Please ask his  friends  what he wants  the most. Start with the Dwarves  in the  village, and don't  you dare mention  my name!  <br>
Will you please  do  this for me?
