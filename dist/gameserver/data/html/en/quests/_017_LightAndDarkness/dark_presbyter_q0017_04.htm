Hierarch:<br>
Very well, brother. Listen carefully! Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Altar of Saints</font>, sprinkle this blood of saint on it and then come back. You may think that this sounds simple... But I warn you... Unless your faith in us is very strong, you won't complete this mission!<br>
So go sprinkle the blood on the <font color="LEVEL">Altar of Saints</font>! You can see it from the path by the entrance to the <font color="LEVEL">Vallet of Saints</font>. Don't get lost on your way there! May Triol watch over you...
