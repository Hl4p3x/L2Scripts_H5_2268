Collector Gutenhagen:<br>
When I first came here, these barracks were full of Dwarves... Now they're deserted!<br>
That is, of course, except for Yumi and me!<br>
Yumi's on some sort or research mission, and I can't just leave her alone!<br>
You don't look like a strong-enough fellow... Come back later if you looking for work.<br>
(This quest can be undertaken by characters level 70 and above)
