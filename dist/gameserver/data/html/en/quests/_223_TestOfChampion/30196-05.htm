Captain Mouen:<br>
We're in trouble! <font color="LEVEL">It turned out to be that the road scavengers that you got rid of were merely an instrument of the leto lizardmen!</font> There is news that the leto lizards are planning a large scale attack on Giran Castle. I guess that Ascalon was right. We must attack them first before they attack us! Many troops have already been sent. Please join them in the fight!<br>
