Veteran Ascalon:<br>
Good! Then first, go and visit my old friend <font color="LEVEL">Mason</font>. He was a comrade of mine. We used to fight together in the battlefields in part of the Iron Rose. Although he has retired now, I am sure he is informed more than anyone else about the invaders who are threatening the townsmen of Dion. Perhaps he might even pick up a spear and head off to the battlefields, stimulated by your young spirits...<br>
I heard that Mason, the master of spears, is living happily with his family <font color="LEVEL">somewhere in Southern Dion</font>. If you bring this letter which has my stamp on it, he will greet you.
