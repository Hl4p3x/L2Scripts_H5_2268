Trader Herbiel:<br>
We are attempting to gather information on 2 fronts. The renowned Spellsinger Adria Lumingshine is currently on the shores of the Sea of Spores, while Hierarch Asterios is attempting to neutralize the poisons that have seeped into our forest. I have been assisting the Hierarch's research by collecting and refining the leaves, roots and spores of various plants.<br>
However, he recently asked me to find a specific kind of spore pollen that is carried here by the wind from the Sea of Spores. The pollen is so fine that the only way to collect it is to extract it from <font color="LEVEL">Spore Fungus</font>.<br>
I'm needed here to oversee the extraction process, which means I need a volunteer to go to the forest and collect <font color="LEVEL">Spore Sacs</font> from <font color="LEVEL">Spore Fungi</font>. Will you help me?<br>
