Head Summoner Radyss:<br>
Either way, you must eventually confront the evil* Archon of Halisha*. Yes, Because he has the fifth Stone of Commune.<br1>
If you go to the Imperial Tomb, you can confront him by entering the Four Sepulchers. If you go to the Shrine of the Loyal, you must attack his minions as you see them. Then the Archon of Halisha will appear.<br1>
OK, leave now! Hack... I will pray to Eva for help.
