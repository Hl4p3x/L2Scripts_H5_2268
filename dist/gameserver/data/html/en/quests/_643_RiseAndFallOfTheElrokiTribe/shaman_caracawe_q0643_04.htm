Shaman Karakawei:<br>
We know not... Perhaps we have been unfaithful. But we must win back Shilen's grace. Without it, we grow weaker with each passing season, sickening like a tree deprived of sunlight. Even the dinosaurs we once commanded turn on us, tearing our people to pieces!<br1>
Outsider, if you are willing to help us to earn back the grace of Shilen, would you donate 300 bones from the dinosaurs of the plains?<br>
