Priest Glyvka:<br>
Patience...<br>
The monsters who inhabit the Cruma Marshlands were also the twisted creations of the Giants' so-called science.<br>
Abandoned and isolated, there must be a large number of them by now. These creatures by their very existence are violations of the order established by Einhasad. They must be destroyed!<br>
We also know of traitors who wish to acquire the secret knowledge of the Giants for themselves and use it against the servants of order.<br>
Your mission is to vanquish both the monsters bred from the chaos of the Cruma Marshlands and the traitors who have been seduced by the Giants' ancient heresy.<br>
