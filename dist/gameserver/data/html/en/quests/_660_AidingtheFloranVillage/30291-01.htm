Captain Alex:<br>
Maria sent you, you say? Hrmph. Unfortunate business, that, Is she doing better?<br>
In any event, I'm glad to see you. We're having a problem with monster incursions, and the militia's spread too thin to handle it. Most of the attacks have been on farmers trying to reclaim and cultivate nearby abandoned land.<br>
I'll wager you're just the type of adventurer we need to fight this problem, and there's a reward in it. Just bring me the <font color="LEVEL">Watching Eyes</font>, a <font color="LEVEL">Golem Shard</font> and a <font color="LEVEL">Delu Lizardman Scale</font> to prove your kills. <br>
Good hunting!<br>
