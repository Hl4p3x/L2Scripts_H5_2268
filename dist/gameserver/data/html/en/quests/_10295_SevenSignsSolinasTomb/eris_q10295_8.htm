Sister of Silence Eris:<br>
You met Solina? Finally, it will be able to leave this world. As, however, I do. But for you is just the beginning, even though you have done so much. You were able to learn the truth about the Seven Seals and stop the Embryo. It remains only one case in which I can help you. But before we get to it, I would like to thank you for what you have given me peace and Solina.
