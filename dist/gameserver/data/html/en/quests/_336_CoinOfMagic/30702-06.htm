Bernard, Hunter Union President:<br>
To be honest with you... after you came to visit me, I was intrigued by what you said and did some research. By getting help from my union members, I found out the areas where the coins are discovered often.<br>
Let me see... What I have found out so far is that... <font color="LEVEL">Lakin</font> and <font color="LEVEL">vanor silenos</font> in the southern part of Aden, and <font color="LEVEL"> timak orcs</font> of northern Oren are in possession of these coins.<br>
Also, <font color="LEVEL">Bandits' Stronghold in Oren, the Cemetery of Kings in Aden and Dragon Valley </font> are the places where the coins are often discovered.
