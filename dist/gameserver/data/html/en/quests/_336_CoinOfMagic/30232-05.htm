Warehouse Keeper Sorint:<br>
Go and meet with the <font color="LEVEL">Hunters Guild's president Bernard</font>. Before you go, take this coin diagram. Take a look at the pictures in the book. This coin is the "kaldis gold dragon" I told you about. Bring back to me the coin that looks exactly like this. I will be waiting for you with a gift that will surprise you. So, please do not fail my expectations!
