Warehouse Keeper Sorint:<br>
Ah, why don't I tell you who our current members are?<br>
First, there is <font color="LEVEL">Sorceress Page</font> of the mystics guild in the Hunters' Village, <font color="LEVEL">Researcher Lorain</font> who is located at the entrance of Cruma Tower, <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Keeper Hagger</font> of Oren Castle Town, <font color="LEVEL">Guard Stan</font> of Oren Castle Town, <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith Duning</font> of the Hunters' Village, <font color="LEVEL">Trader Ralford</font> at the basement of the Ivory Tower, <font color="LEVEL">Head Blacksmith Ferris</font> of Aden Castle Town, <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Keeper Collob</font> who is located in front of the accessory store in Giran Castle Town and <font color="LEVEL">Grocer Pano</font> in the square of Floran Village...<br>
Wow, now I realize that our members are spread out all over the place. But we still have a long way to go. My dream is that the coins we are collecting will become a secondary currency! Then everybody on the continent will become members of our club! Ha ha ha!! Won't that be great?<br>
