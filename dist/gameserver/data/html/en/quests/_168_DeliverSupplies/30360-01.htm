Master Harant:<br>
Ah, so <font color="LEVEL">Jeanine</font> sent you. The new weapons for the sentries have been finished. This is all thanks to <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith Karrod</font>, who has worked day and night to finish them. These are prime swords crafted of adamantite. But I have not finished the task of casting magic on these weapons. Well, it's not anything elaborate, just magic that makes the sword a little bit lighter and the blade a little bit sharper.<br>
I need more time to finish my task ... But since <font color="LEVEL">Jeanine</font> seems so anxious, go and deliver these <font color="LEVEL">three swords</font> that are finished. And give her regards from <font color="LEVEL">Master Harant</font>.
