Sentry Jeanine:<br>
So <font color="LEVEL">Master Harant</font> has not finished his task yet. We need to get that equipment soon ...<br>
Well, we must first deliver these weapons to my sisters. Give me one sword, to begin with. And deliver the rest to <font color="LEVEL">Sentry Roselyn</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Sentry Krispen</font>. Bring back the <font color="LEVEL">old bronze swords</font> they have been using while you're at it.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Roselyn</font> is standing guard at the entrance of the village. You can reach her by going through the cave behind me. And <font color="LEVEL">Krispen</font> is on duty at the village entrance opposite <font color="LEVEL">Roselyn</font>.
