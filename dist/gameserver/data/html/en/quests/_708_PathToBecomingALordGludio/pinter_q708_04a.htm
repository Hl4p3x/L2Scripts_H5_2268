Blacksmith Pinter:<br>
What are you doing? Unless you supply us with materials, the reconstruction work will have to stop. We are relying on you. Don't let us down!<br>
You do know what's needed, right? The materials that we need now are 100 pieces of animal skin, 100 varnish, 100 iron ore, and 50 cokes.
