Master Orkurus:<br>
Are you sure you want to be a Berserker? To be a Berserker, you must first pass the test of our Berserker Guild.<br>
You show promise, but I think you need additional training before you will be ready to undertake this test.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a Trooper class character who is level 39 or above.)
