Master Tenan:<br>
We have avoided the brut of the raider`s attack and are windrawing secretly. Howler, they have dispatched a small force o alert the main enemy units of our location.<br>
First, we must eliminate that force before they contact the main enemy group. They moved off to the west, so I contacted Master Entien in the Town of Dion to pursue them. You should go to Dion Castle Village and help in the pursult.<br>
I Will leave any message from Harilgamed beneath the brigde.<br>
