Separated Soul:<br>
He has his loyal subordinates, their group is called <font color="LEVEL">Wings of Sand</font>.<br>
They are preparing the attack simultaneously so it'll be hard to defeat them.<br>
But there's a way. Use Dragon Vortex to summon any of the seben of them: <font color="LEVEL">Emerald Horn, Dust Rider, Bleeding Fly, Black Dagger Wing, Shadow Summoner, Spike Slasher, Muscle Bomber</font>.<br>
Once you can separate each of them it'll give you a chance.<br>
I need you to kill as more as you can, but I can reward you for <font color="LEVEL">one</font> of <font color="LEVEL">two</font> monsters slayed.<br>
