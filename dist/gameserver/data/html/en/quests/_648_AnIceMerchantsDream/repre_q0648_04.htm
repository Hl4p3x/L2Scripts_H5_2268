Most of the creatures around here have a Black Ice Crystal in their bodies. It seems that the crystals make them very violent. We need to study those crystals. Bring me some and you'll be well-rewarded! Of course, you probably will not always get Black Ice Crystals, sometimes you will get Silver Ice Crystals. If you bring me these Silver Ice Crystals, I will also reward you.<br>
