Tablet of Vision:<br>
Countless thoughts beyond comprehension sear painfully into your brain. It seems that I heard someone laughing.<br1>
The man said. "One more hero you wanted is born here again."<br1>
A lady with blue clothes answered. "No, he is just a baby who starts toddling. But, he won't be only under his mother's protection anymore"<br1>
A goddess engraved on the way of pilgrimage like this: You are free beings. Yoke called Race, Negligence called Stability. The Elf that got hurt by betrayal,closed the door to the world and stopped breathing. The Mother Tree being rotten.<br1>
A voice is heard from the head.<br1>
<font color="LEVEL">Baby, you are now ready to help me. Then, go back to Aden and put an end to your pilgrimage. In my Temple, you will keep my honor.</font>
