Master Sinden:<br>
Panacea had a fight with his younger brother, Kastien, who felt it wasn't right to stop the pilgrimage since it was established by the goddess Eva. He gave me the Stone of Commune and sealed it so that only by helping other races could it be used.<br1>
The key of binding was divided in two and given to the lesser Orcs and the Silenos, who founded the Ketra Orc and Varka Silenos tribes.<br1>
Which side will you get the key from?<br>
