Tablet of Vision:<br>
A sharp blast of knowlege courses through your cranium! A vision appears of a black knight!<br1>
And there is your old comrade Panacea! What is that substance holding him?! Chains that have bound him!<br1>
You sense a power that rejects change because of a desire for rest...<br1>
You sense that weariness coming over you. The next Stone of Commune is in the northern Forsaken Plains!
