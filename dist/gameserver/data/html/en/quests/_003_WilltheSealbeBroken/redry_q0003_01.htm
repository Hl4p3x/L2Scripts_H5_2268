Tetrarch Talloth:<br>
For hundreds of years, I have devoted my life to researching a method to break the seal that was placed on our Hierarch. I've received news that ancient magic scrolls have been discovered in the northern lands of Pabel, and they say that the scrolls contain secrets of dark arts that we have not yet learned.<br>
If the scrolls were to be brought here, we would be able to discover a method for breaking the seal placed on our Hierarch. I may need your help then, to gather materials needed for performing this magic when the time comes.<br>
(Quest for Dark Elven characters level 16 or above.)
