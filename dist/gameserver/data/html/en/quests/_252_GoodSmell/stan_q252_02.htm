What? Oh, sorry. It's just... Someone cooked something and it smells REALLY good. But yes, we called it Skyshadow Meadow until the Sel Mahums started using it for battle training. Gave it some goofy nameâ€¦ Sel Mahum Training Grounds I think. Should have named it 'What the hell is that delicious smell??'.<br>
Hey, good buddy of mine, how about a little adventure? Find what is making that yummy smell and bring it to me? PLEASE?<br>
