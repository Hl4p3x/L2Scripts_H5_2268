Prefect Tazki:<br>
Tejarka Paagrio! Your spirit shall lead you to the source of ancient Orcish power!<br1>
Long ago, a legendary warrior abandoned his path, and devoted all his time to training a disciple.<br1>
The youth thrived, and soon became as strong as his master. Then, without warning, he disappeared!<br1>
Here's all the information we've been able to gather about him. You should speak with Prefect Lakan of Goddard Castle Town. At one time he was the strongest warrior of the Atuba tribe!
