Tablet of Vision:<br>
You hear a disturbance as you approach the tablet.<br1>
Sounds of rocks crashing, and the roar of a warrior resisting them!<br1>
No fear of the most awesome opponent, eager for death in battle!<br1>
They say Orcs were stronger back in the day and I'm inclined to believe them. But I also know that their fiery blood hasn't changed!<br1>
Is that actually the tablet? The sound of swordplay is carried on the wind.<br>
