Prefect Lakan:<br>
This Bitter Cold Vodka is truly the nectar of the gods!<br1>
It seems like an eternity since I've tasted it! The burn melts my heart and brings back old memories, even though it lacks the true flame of Paagrio!<br1>
I'll tell you my story now, my friend.<br1>
My mistake was failing in my attempt to seize the Tower of Insolence! I haven't been a warrior since! I tried teaching for a while, but I was abandoned by my disciple.<br1>
And that's not all!<br>
