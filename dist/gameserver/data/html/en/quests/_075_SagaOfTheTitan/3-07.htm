Seer Skahi:<br>
Duda-Mara's spirit is preparing us for the eternal winter.<br1>
Here is your test. The Ketra Orcs, a lower race who betrayed us long ago, and the Varka Silenos are at war. They each have a* Divine Stone of Wisdom*, but you must earn their absolute trust to get it.<br1>
Bring either stone to pass the test.<br1>
Which side do you choose?<br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 75 3-6">Ketra Orcs</a><br1>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 75 3-7">Varka Silenos</a>
