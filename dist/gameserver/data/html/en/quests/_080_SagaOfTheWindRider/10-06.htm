Tablet of Vision:<br>
You feel a familiar energy coursing through you, and receive a new vision.<br1>
You can feel the pleasure, pain, anger and love of all those who have sought this power.<br1>
The screams you hear are your own.<br1>
The flood of emotions renders you unconscious.<br1>
You awaken and your mouth moves, but no words are formed. Could this be the end?
