Scroll Seller Elena:<br>
This is heavenly!<br1>
Now I'll tell you as promised. According to the old documents, after the battle against the Titans, Einhasad prevented the lower races from getting the power.<br1>
However, Gran Kain and Eva secretly sealed part of the power into the tablets and spread them around the world. Maybe they were waiting for someone to discover it.<br1>
Here's a Stone of Commune I found while researching. You need this to get the power of the tablet.<br1>
The first tablet is south of the Tower of Insolence. Find it!
