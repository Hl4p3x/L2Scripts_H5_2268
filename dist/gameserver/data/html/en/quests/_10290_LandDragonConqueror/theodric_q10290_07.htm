Antharas Watchman Theodric:<br>
And so it is done. Antharas has been stopped and his return prevented.<br>
I have something for you... something that I rarely am allowed to give. The <font color="LEVEL">Antharas Slayer Circlet</font> is yours.<br>
What now? I stay, I wait, and I watch. Antharas can never truly be killed. I can only hope that brave warriors such as you come to help and stop Antharas whenever it attempts to return.
