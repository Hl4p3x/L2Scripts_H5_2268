High Priestess Levian:<br>
The followers of Einhasad will always be subject to trials. Now is no different, as  the people of Gludio are being confronted by evil itself.<br>
Lizardmen are reptiles. They look somewhat like dragons. They are just the lackeys of Shilen. The true evil we must confront is <font color="LEVEL">evil spirit Bifrons</font>, who is secretly controlling the actions of the lizardmen. Please help us deal with him.<br>
