Outstanding! I'll tell you how to obtain the reagents i need. Slay the evil creatures in the Tower of Insolence and the Blazing Swamp and collect reagent ingredients. Once you collect the ingredients, use the <font color="LEVEL">Mixing Urn</font> wich is placed right here in the basement of the tower to create reagents. Take this <font color="LEVEL">Mixing Manual</font>, which has plenty of notes i took all during my life as a reagent supplier. Read it carefully and you will find all the information you need about how to use the urn, the formulas, etc.<br>
Ah! You will need a Mixing Stone in order to operate the urn as well... Take this one and don't lose it!<br>
About the ingredients, you should be able to obtain them by hunting <font color="LEVEL">Crendions, Hallate's Maids, Hallate's guardians, Platinum Tribe shamans and Platinum Guardian Shamans</font> in the Tower of Insolence. And in the Blazing Swamp, <font color="LEVEL">Lava Wyrms and Hames Orc Shamans</font> are the creatures of choice.<br>
You may get going now, remember we are delayed with these potions... hope to hear from you soon!
