Summoner Belinda:<br>
First, you must speak with* Messenger Wahkan* of the Ketra Orcs. They're hiring mercenaries, and this is a great opportunity to earn their trust!<br1>
<font color="LEVEL">Soul Guide Asefa</font>, the Chief Shaman of the Ketra Orcs, has something they call the* Divine Stone of Wisdom*.<br1>
We must get it from them! If things don't go well with Asefa, try the Varka Silenos tribe. They have one too.<br1>
Good luck!
