Magister Kaiena: <br>
Ha!<br>
Gauen had the gall to say such things!?<br>
It is he who wished to keep the Giants' research documents.<br>
His greed and duplicity are almost unbelievable...<br>
He pretends to be an honorable man, but the real Gauen is a mystery.<br>
I swear that what we did, we did to prevent the documents from falling into the nands of Beleth.<br>
That was the perfect opportunity for Gauen to steal them himself and concort this lame excuse.<br>
If he really had nothing to hide, why would he involve Manashen?<br>
