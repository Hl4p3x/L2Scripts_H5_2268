Magister Gaius: <br>
Well, yes and no.<br>
One of our operatives did recover the document near Death Pass, but...<br>
while en route to us, he was attacked by the <font color="LEVEL">Manashen Gargoyles near the Ivory Tower</font>. We have not been able to locate either him or the document he was carrying.<br>
The timing of the attack is no coincidence; something must have gone very wrong...
