Magister Gauen:<br>
Both Kaiena's men and our forces were exhausted from fighting each other.<br>
At that moment, Beleth's well-known female minion appeared and took the documents.<br>
Undoubtedly Beleth was as eager to possess those documents as Kaiena was.<br>
He must have learned about them throught our quarrel with Kaiena.<br>
That is the truth, whatever others tell you.<br>
Do not be deceived!<br>
(Speak with <font color="LEVEL">Kaiena</font> as well.)
