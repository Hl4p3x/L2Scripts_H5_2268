Warehouse Keeper Holvas:<br>
Is that so? Well, if Poitan saw fit to tell you, then I guess I can tell you as well.<br>
There are many people who are curious about you, you know...<br>
That's why I think I can sell this manuscript for a handsome price!<br>
I was able to procure the manuscript secretly, and I intended to have if brought here.<br>
But during the journey, raiders attacked my messenger at the <font color="LEVEL">Execution Grounds</font>. He cannot be found -- and neither can the manuscript.<br>
Would you be willing to find the pieces of the manuscript?<br>
If you gather all the pieces and bring them to me, I will bind a book for you free of charge.<br>
