Grand Master Meldina:<br>
I am member of the secret society you have been investigating...<br>
We are called Inquisitors among those who know of our existence.<br>
It is our responsibility to protect the secrets of the Kamael, as well as to unearth conspiracies that might threaten our people. Our work is highly secretive.<br>
We have watched you face dangers and solve problems to obtain this manuscript, and we think you have the skills to take the class transfer test.<br>
If you pass if, you will obtain a power that can take you beyond your current combat skill, just like the rest of our order.<br>
What do you say? Are you interested?<br>
