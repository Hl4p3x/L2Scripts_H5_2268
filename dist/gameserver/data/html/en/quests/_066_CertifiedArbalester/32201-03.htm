Master Rindy:<br>
Cadet! I am Rindy, a commander in the Steelrazor, the elite force of the Kamael. So you are the one who captured Tak, eh?<br>
You did well, and we learned much. But what is your business with me now?<br>
Hmm...you wish to become an Arbalester, eh?<br>
The entrance exam is very difficult, you know...<br>
Do you really want to be a Arbalester?<br>
