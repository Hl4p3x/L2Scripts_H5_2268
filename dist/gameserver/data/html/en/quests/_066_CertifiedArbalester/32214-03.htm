Grand Master Meldina:<br>
Very well...<br>
Hand me the encrypted manuscript you have brought.<br>
I know the contents of the manuscript, but it is something not suited for you... yet.<br>
Do not be disappointed, however. You will have an opportunity to learn it later for yourself.<br>
In the meantime, take this badge and find <font color="LEVEL">Selsia in Hunters Village</font>.<br>
There you will receive further instructions.<br>
I have every confidence in you, my young friend.<br>
Good luck!
