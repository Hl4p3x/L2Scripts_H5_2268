Prefect Vokiyan:<br>
Good! Then, I Prefect Vokiyan, shall give you the orders! Find the magical creatures that I point out from now on, conquer them and bring back the proof of your victory!<br>
First, if you go near the Ivory Tower of Oren, you'll find <font color="LEVEL">Manasen</font>, the so-called 'flying stone statue'. Break him into pieces and bring 10 shards of his body as the trophy!<br>
Next, if you go to the wasteland area of Gludio, there are the <font color="LEVEL">Paagrio Crusaders </font> who are often called as the 'tyrants of the wild'. Kill them and bring back their claws! You must bring at least 10 of them!<br>
Finally, you'll be able to find the <font color="LEVEL">guardian basilisk</font> which is also called as the 'guardian of barren earth', in the Corridors of Death! Knock him down and bring his teeth as the voucher! You must also bring 10 of them!<br>
For you who inherited the power and dignity of Orc, this test will be an easy one! Promptly return after completing your mission! I shall be waiting for you!
