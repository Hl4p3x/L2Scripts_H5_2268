Lennunt Chief Harak:<br>
My noble oak of the ancient kingdom, I have been waiting for the messenger of Paagrio Lord. Kasman, the Chief of Gludin told me that soon enough the messenger of the Monarch will visit me!<br>
So you are the messenger? I can't believe it. <font color="LEVEL">Unless you show me the handwritten letter of the Lord...!</font>
