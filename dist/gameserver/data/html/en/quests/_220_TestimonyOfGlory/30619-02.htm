Vuku Chief Driko:<br>
For us, survival is the greatest virtue. I expected that there will come a day when this seal will be traded for the safety of our tribe. We have many difficulties in this area where there are often conflicts with Men. We are planning to go back to our base camps. We are moving to the eastern swamp area. But the reason we moved here in the first place was because of the grotesque insect tribe which drove us out.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">If you sweep them from our area, I will give you back the Scepter of Flame of yours</font>. Will you accept my proposal?<br>
