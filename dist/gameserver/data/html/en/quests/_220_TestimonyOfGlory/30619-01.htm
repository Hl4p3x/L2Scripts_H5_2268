Vuku Chief Driko:<br>
Thou, oppressor of flames, how come such a noble person came to this obscure place? Did you come to see me Driko, leader of the low people?<br>
Right now, I am facing a big problem which is a matter of life and death for our tribe! I have no interest in the glory of the old kingdom.<br>
Unless you bring an <font color="LEVEL">autograph letter by your Prefect</font>, which means that unless you have an urgent matter, I Driko, the leader of the lows have nothing to discuss with you anymore.
