Prefect Vokiyan:<br>
Do you know! Seers are all saying that the eternal winter is approaching! It won't be long...  We must prepare for the days of chaos and destruction, and the distressed days of endless wars and disasters.<br>
People of your tribe are weak and idle. We can't expect anything from them. We are stronger than any other tribe! We shall conquer all the inferior tribes and reconstruct the <font color="LEVEL">great kingdom of Orcs to fight against the darkness of the chaotic days. And the victory will be ours!</font><br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 220 30514-04.htm">I shall participate in the reconstruction of the kingdom!</a>
