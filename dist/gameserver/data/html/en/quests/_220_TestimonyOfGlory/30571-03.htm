Seer Tanapi:<br>
The goblin grave thieves have been incited by the Ragna tribe to destroy the tombs. That is what the spirits of wind whispered into my ears. The scepter is now in the hands of Ragna tribe. I don't know any further information but the fact that the <font color="LEVEL">Chief or the Seer of Ragna tribe</font> has it.<br>
They are trying to call out the spirit of Tantos tribe leader with the scepter. At this very moment, they are trying to carry out the ceremony, somewhere on the  <font color="LEVEL">Indomitable Plateau</font>. You must find them, stop the ceremony, and get back the scepter! Hurry!
