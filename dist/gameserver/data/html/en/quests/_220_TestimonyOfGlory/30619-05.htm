Vuku Chief Driko:<br>
Well done! I will <font color="LEVEL">return the scepter</font> as I had promised before. I am not at all interested in the reconstruction of our ancient kingdom nor in the symbol of its authority. You noble Orcs will die in the end after fighting for the supremacy over the continent, be we shall survive until the end!
