Gandi Chief Chianta:<br>
I do not expect to see you again until you have recovered the <font color="LEVEL">Scepters of the Breka, Enku, Vuku, Turek, and Lennunt tribes</font>! This is an important first step towards reuniting the greater Orc kingdom! You must not take your duty lightly! For the whereabouts of these renegade Orcs, ask <font color="LEVEL">Manakia of Giran Castle Town</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Prefect Kasman of Gludin</font>.
