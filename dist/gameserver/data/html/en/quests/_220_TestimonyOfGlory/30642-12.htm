Gandi Chief Chianta:<br>
Go now to the eternal homeland of the Orcs, the <font color="LEVEL">Indomitable Plateau</font>, and present the Lord of Flame with the seals you have recovered! But before you meet with the Lord, go to <font color="LEVEL">Seer Tanapi</font> first. He shall teach you the protocols you must know before holding an audience with the Paagrio Lord!
