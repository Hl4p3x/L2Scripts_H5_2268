First, meet* Messenger Naran Ashanuk* of the Varka Silenos tribe. They've been hiring mercenaries, and this is a great opportunity to gain their trust!<br1>
<font color="LEVEL">Soul Guide Udan Mardui</font>, the Chief Shaman of the Varka Silenos has a* Divine Stone of Wisdom* that we simply must have!<br1>
