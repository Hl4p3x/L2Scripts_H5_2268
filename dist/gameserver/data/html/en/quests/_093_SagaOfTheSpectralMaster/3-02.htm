Grand Magister Fairen:<br>
First you must meet with* Messenger Wahkan* of the Ketra Orcs.They've been hiring mercenaries, and this is a great opportunity to gain their trust!<br1>
<font color="LEVEL">Soul Guide Asefa</font>, the Chief Shaman of the Ketra Orcs has a* Divine Stone of Wisdom* that we simply must have!<br1>
If things don't go well with the Ketras, you should try the Varka Silenos tribe. They also have a stone. Good luck!
