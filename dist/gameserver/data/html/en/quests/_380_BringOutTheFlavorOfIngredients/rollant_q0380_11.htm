Magister Rollant:<br>
It's done! Now it must marinate in the sauce. When it's hardened you can eat it. I call it "Rollant's Special Ritron Jelly".<br>
Can you taste the hint of Moon Flower? I added the ritron fruit to the ritron sauce to really intensify the flavor.<br>
It melts in your mouth but still has a lovely texture, doesn't it? Eat up!<br>
