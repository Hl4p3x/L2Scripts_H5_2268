Vice Hierarch Eindburgh:<br>
Kamael Warriors. Perfect soldiers! But even the sharpest sword is useless without a skilled wielder.<br>
I know Kekropus has said, in the hopes that our power will not be abused, that the blade is enough for us -- but a sword is of no use unless someone draws it. We need more than simply <font color="LEVEL">a leader who keeps the blade sharp for some undetermined future</font> -- we need one unafraid to lead us into that future.<br>
Only through decisive action can we finally become the blade of chaos our creators intended us to be, and achieve our true destiny.<br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 61 subelder_aientburg_q0061_06.htm">Ask about that destiny.</a>
