Vice Hierarch Eindburgh:<br>
You may wish to refuse, but it may not be possible. A shackle of the creator still remains in you and may unconsciously limit your advancement.<br>
But you cannot allow others to make the decision for you.<br>
Don't you see? All you have seen, all you have experienced, show that we are heading for the final conflict and destruction.<br>
But take heart! Execute the laws you believe should be executed. That will become one of the factors of chaos -- a variable that may yet influence that final battle.<br>
In your soul, you are already a Judicator...
