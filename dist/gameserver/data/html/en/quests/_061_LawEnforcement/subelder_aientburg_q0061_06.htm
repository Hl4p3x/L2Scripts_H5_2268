Vice Hierarch Eindburgh:<br>
I think you know -- it is what we Kamael were created to fight against: the gods themselves.<br>
The power of today's adventurers is not even remotely comparable to their power. Even the strongest race on the earth, the Giants, who once controlled all the creatures and even unlocked the secrets of life, suffered defeated at their hands.<br>
Nornil set his last hope on us, but... Can we really hope to fight the gods and <font color="LEVEL">win</font>?<br>
I do not think so, and I speak with all the knowledge and insight inherited by the Hierarchs of Metucela since the time of Nostra, the father of the Inspectors. We Kamael were created to achieve an inherently impossible proposition. But what if, as Nostra the orized, something completely unexpected were to happen?<br>
