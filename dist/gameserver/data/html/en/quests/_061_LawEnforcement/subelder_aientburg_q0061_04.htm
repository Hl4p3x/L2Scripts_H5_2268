Vice Hierarch Eindburgh:<br>
The Seeds of Chaos were planted by the King of Chaos to enable their recipients to overcome the restrictions imposed on mortals by the gods.<br>
This is why the wielders of Enuma Elish can still live, despite being cursed by the gods.<br>
If this power is manifested, we Kamael can finally free ourselves from our fate as warriors who live only for battle. One who walks this other path is the Inspector.<br>
It is a possibility that even our creators couldn't imagine.<br>
