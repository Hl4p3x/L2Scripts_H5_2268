High Priest Innocentin:<br>
Recent activities at the Pagan Temple have raised my concerns. Considering the shenanigans that normally go on there, you must surely understand the peril!<br>
You see, they've set their sights on Saint Solina's Grail of Splendor! I'm sure that if we don`t stop them, something terrible and irrevocable will happen! Will you help us in our time of need?<br>
