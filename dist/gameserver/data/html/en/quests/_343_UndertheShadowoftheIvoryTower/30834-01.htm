Have you heard about Nebulite? It is a mineral often found in meteorites. 
Processed properly, even a tiny amount tremendous energy. It is quite 
valuable to those who seek to amplify magical power.<br>
The Dwarwes say that Nebulite was used by Titans as their primary source 
of energy. At that time the mineral was abundant, but the expansion of 
the titan civilization exhausted most of the precious material. 
Nowadeys it is quite rare, and can only be found in a few places...<br>
