Magic Trader Cema:<br>
Will you join our research? We are investigation the use of Nebulite for the 
greater public good. However, we are having a hard time finding Nebilte for our 
study. The Dwarwen collectors we hired for this task have not been heard from 
in over a month.<br>
Would you do this work for us? Arround the crater of Ivory Tower you will find 
<font color="LEVEL">Manashen gargoyles</font>, <font color="LEVEL">enchanted monster eyes</font>, <font color="LEVEL">enchanted stone golems</font>, and 
<font color="LEVEL">enchanted iron golems</font>. They have fallen under the spell of <font color="LEVEL">Nebulite Orbs</font>, 
which are fragments of the meteorite. If you kill these monsters you can easily 
collect the Nebulite samples we need for our research.<br>
You shall be well-compensated for you efforts.<br>
