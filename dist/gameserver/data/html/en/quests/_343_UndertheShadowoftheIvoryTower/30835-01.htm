Lich King Icarus:<br>
What a miserable state I'm in, neither dead or alive, just here. What's the point? 
I'm undead... No hope for me. The liqueur supplied by my students is all that 
keeps me going these days. I get drunk and imagine that I can feel warmth of 
life folowing throught my veins once again...<br>
Oh, I suppose you are wondering how an undead can drink liqueur? Have you heard 
of <font color="LEVEL">Ectoplazm Liqueur</font>? That stuff will raise a corpse from his grave to dance! 
It is so strong that even my old, rotten tongue twitches at its taste. 
Ahhhh... What I would give for a sip right now!..<br>
