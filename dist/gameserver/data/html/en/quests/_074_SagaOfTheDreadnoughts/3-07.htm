Grand Master Bernhard:<br>
She asked me to keep the Stone of Commune until someone worthy came to me for it. She also says that it's not complete. To make it perfect you will need a* Divine Stone of Wisdom*! There are two pieces held by opposing forces, the Ketra Orcs and the Varka Silenos. Both threaten Goddard.<br1>
Bring back either of the stones. It won't be easy! You must earn their absolute trust. Which side will you choose?<br>
