Tablet of Vision:<br>
A sharp blast of knowledge sears painfully into your brain. You hear the sound of distant laughter.<br1>
A man announces the birth of another Hero.<br1>
The woman in blue disagrees... A child no longer, but still young.<br1>
The power of all dragons is Shilen's, and she fights with her children by her side. But only the strongest power can bring peace!<br1>
Visions of dragons flash through your mind. A human who imitates the dragon in combat would command tremendous physical power when outnumbered!<br1>
You feel this power coursing through you! Go back to Master Aiken in Aden Castle Town.
