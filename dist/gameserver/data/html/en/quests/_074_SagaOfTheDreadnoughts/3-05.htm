Grand Master Bernhard:<br>
You're back! Did you bring the Divine Stone of Wisdom?<br1>
Good job! You are as capable as the bride of Antharas told me.<br1>
Now I'll give you the Stone of Commune. The stone tablet that forms a union with it is north of the Varka Silenos stronghold.<br1>
I'd like to see it myself, but I'm not a descendant of a dragon like you. The bride left a note with me.<br>
