Blacksmith Altran:<br>
According to Roien's research, the blade was broken in half. I think they're somewhere in the Elven Ruins. Or maybe <font color="LEVEL">those dirty orcs who live in the ruins have gotten their paws on them...</font> Those orcs don't know how to handle metal, so they won't be able to reforge the broken pieces into one blade. They're probably using them to peel rabbit skins or something like that.<br>
Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Elven Ruins</font> and find <font color="LEVEL">the two broken sword blade pieces.</font> In case you don't know how to get into the ruins, I'll write it down for you in this note. Be careful! Orcs aren't the worst of the dangers in those ruins.
