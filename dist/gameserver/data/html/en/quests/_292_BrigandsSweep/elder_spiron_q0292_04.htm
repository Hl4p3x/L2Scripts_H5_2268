Elder Spiron:<br>
Why have you returned empty handed? Don't tell me that you've forgotten what your job is.<br>
Given the urgency of the situation, let me tell you one more time! Your job is to punish the insolent goblins that are interrupting our guild's trade. <font color="LEVEL">Defeat the goblins and bring their necklaces as proof.</font> I will reward you based on the number and type of necklaces that you bring.<br>
Now! Leave at once! Time is money!<br>

<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 292 elder_spiron_q0292_07.htm">Say you will continue</a>
