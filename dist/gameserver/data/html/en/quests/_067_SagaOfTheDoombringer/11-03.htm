Master Digler:<br>
We must have this amulet to attract the opponents who are interested in Enuma Elish. Fortunately, it can be obtained through other means...<br1>
One way is to defeat the <font color="LEVEL">Demon Halisha,</font> who is located within <font color="LEVEL">the Four Sepulchers.</font> you must form a party to enter.<br1>
If that proves too difficult, defeat the followers of Halisha at the <font color="LEVEL">Shrine of Loyalty.</font> By doing so, you can earn "tickets." Once you have acquired over <font color="LEVEL">700</font> tickets, Halisha himself will appear. By the way, the creatures you must face are the <font color="LEVEL">Grave Scarab, Scavenger Scarab, Grave Ant, Scavenger Ant, Shrine Knight and Stander.</font>
