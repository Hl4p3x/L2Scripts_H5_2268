Master Digler:<br>
In order to renew the power of the damaged amulet, we need the Divine Stone of Wisdom and its strong spiritual power.<br1>
That stone is possessed by two great magicians: the Soul Guide Asefa of the Ketra Orcs and the Soul Guide Udan Mardui of the Varka Silenos.<br1>
They will award the stone to the most intelligent ones among their kind. If you can gain eithers' trust and prove your worthiness, they will give you the stone.<br1>
There is no other way than to obtain the Divine Stone of Wisdom other than from them. What will you do?<br>
