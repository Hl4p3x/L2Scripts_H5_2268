Then you must embark upon a journey to unleash your sealed power. Scattered throughout the world there are magical objects that can help<br1>
unlock your potential called Tablets of Vision. These <font color="LEVEL">6</font> Tablets of Vision should provide you the insight<br1>
necessary to break the seal. Visit <font color="LEVEL">Master Duroga in the Town of Aden.</font> He will give you additional details.<br1>
On this quest, you will also likely encounter the Guard of Vision, Eranude, who is a kind of watchman for the Tablets of Vision. His task<br1>

Approach him with great care!
