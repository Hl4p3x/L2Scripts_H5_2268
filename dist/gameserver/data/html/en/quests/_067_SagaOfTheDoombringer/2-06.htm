Master Duroga:<br>
*The Tablets tend to attract their corresponding Amulets, which will reveal the location to you.*<br1>
After you have communicated with this Tablet, the location of the next Resonance Amulet will also be revealed to you. Through this process you will be able to acquire each of the Amulets in turn and complete the quest.<br1>
Here is the first Amulet. Take it to the <font color="LEVEL">Tablet of Vision located south of the Tower of Insolence.</font>
