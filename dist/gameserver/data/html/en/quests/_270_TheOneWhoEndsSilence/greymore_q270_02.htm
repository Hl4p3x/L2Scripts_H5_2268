Priest Greymore:<br>
Yes, fool, leave me to my craft... wait. Wait! Don't go yet, something just occurred to me.<br>
Brother Dominic assigned me a mission and I think you might be able to help me with this one. You see, I have a dream. In this dream, I am not stuck in this dreary Monastery surrounded by these dreary humorless monks. You can help make this dream a reality.<br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 270 greymore_q270_03.htm">Accept the mission.</a>
