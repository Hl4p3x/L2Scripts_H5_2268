Grand Master Samael:<br>
The* Archon of Halisha* has the next Stone of Commune.<br1>
You can find the Archon inside the Four Sepulchers in the Imperial Tomb. You mustn't enter that dreadful place alone!<br1>
If you're unable to form a party for some reason, massacre the Archon's minions in the Shrine of the Loyal. Kill enough of them, say around 700, and he will appear.<br1>
His minions are called Grave Scarabs, Scavenger Scarabs, Grave Ants, Scavenger Ants, Shrine Knights and Shrine Guards.<br1>
The Tablet of Vision that you seek can be found on the road to* Goddard from the Wall of Argos*.
