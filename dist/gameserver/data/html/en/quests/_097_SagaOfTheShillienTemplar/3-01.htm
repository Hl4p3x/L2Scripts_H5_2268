Grand Master Samael:<br>
Welcome back! Tell me, what have you learned?<br1>
The forbidden knowledge is truly passed on to the one who holds the Stone of Commune.<br1>
Good job! But, why did you come back?<br1>
The Stone of Commune? You mean this? Actually, there were several fragments attached to the tablet. I gave you the analyzed one. This may be the one that you're looking for now. Unfortunately, it's incomplete. You must find another fragment! In fact, I know where the fragment is, but haven't been able to get it yet, as it will be quite difficult. Will you get it for me?<br>
