Magister Hanellin:<br>
A long time ago, three sacred relics were locked away and hidden away. In time, people have managed to find some mysterious treasure boxes that are thought to contain the relics. However, they are all guarded by strong monsters...so naturally, you will have to kill these guardians in order to get the relics!<br>
Meet with <font color="LEVEL">Claudia Athebaldt</font> in Aden Castle Town, <font color="LEVEL">Martien</font> in Giran Castle Town and <font color="LEVEL">Magister Harne</font> in Dark Elven Village. At each meeting you will be given the location of an ark containing a sacred relic. They will mark on the map the location of each ark with a red flag. Once you find and retrieve a sacred relic, the red mark will disappear. Now, go and collect the three sacred relics. (If a flag disappears before you find a sacred relic, return to the person who marked its location on the map and make your inquiry again. The flag will reappear).<br>
I have given you a letter to give to each of them. I explain everything to them there. Talk to them, find the three relics, and come back to me when you are done!
