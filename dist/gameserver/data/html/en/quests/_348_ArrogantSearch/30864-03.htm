That is really good news. I like the kind of people like you. Anyway, here is what I wish of you for now: go to the Giants Cave, defeat a <font color="LEVEL">Lesser Giant Elder</font> or a <font color="LEVEL">Lesser Giant Mage</font> and bring back the Titan's Powerstone that they carry. I only need one stone, so it shouldn't be too hard for you.
