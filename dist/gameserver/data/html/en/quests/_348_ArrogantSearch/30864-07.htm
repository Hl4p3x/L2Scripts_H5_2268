Magister Hanellin:<br>
You came just in time! I was just done with all the preparations I needed to make. Here, take this white fabric and listen carefully.<br>
You need to dip the cloth in the blood of a <font color="LEVEL">Platinum Tribe Overlord</font> or a <font color="LEVEL">Platinum Tribe Shaman</font>. Once you have made the cloth completely red from their blood, come back to me and I promise to tell you a secret.
