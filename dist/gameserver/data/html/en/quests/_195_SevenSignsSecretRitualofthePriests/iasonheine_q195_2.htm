Oh yes, yes I can. But I'm afraid my Elmoreden is rather out of practice, and the language was created to confuse outsiders. Pronounce one syllable differently and the whole sentence changes or loses meaning you see, and written Elmoreden is simply a phonetic interpretation of the spoken language....<br>
