Saint of Light Agnes:<br>
I'll fill the granary with this generous gift. Thanks to your help, these people can walk the path of light once more.<br1>
Now I can help you! A woman named* Luna* told me of how one can step beyond his own limitations. You remind me of her.<br1>
Take this Stone of Commune to the Tablet of Vision,* south of the Tower of Insolence*. It will bring you new knowledge.
