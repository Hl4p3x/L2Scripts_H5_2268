Priest Dominic:<br>
Here is the letter. This task makes you one of my own, which means that should you lose this letter or fail this task, you will be mine to punish. It also means Aquilani will recognize my presence in you when you seek him out.<br>
Do not deter from the path. Seek <font color="LEVEL">Aquilani</font> and he will show you the way to Greymore in the <font color="LEVEL">Monastery of Silence</font>.
