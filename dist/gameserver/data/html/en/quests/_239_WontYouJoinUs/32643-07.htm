Priestess Athenia:<br>
Hmm.... you've done better than I thought you would. But I'm not sure if I trust you yet. Do one more thing for me, and my confidence in you will never be in question again.<br>
Return to the Fields of Silence and defeat the <font color="LEVEL">Suppressors</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Exterminators</font> that you encounter there.
 Bring me back <font color="LEVEL">20 Enchanted Golem Fragments</font> and your place amongst us will be secured.
