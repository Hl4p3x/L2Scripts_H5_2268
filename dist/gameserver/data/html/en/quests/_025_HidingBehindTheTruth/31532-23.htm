Maid of Lidia:<br>
I was hoping we would meet again.<br1>
I forgot to tell you something very important.<br>
My body may be gone, but now I can live my own life and follow my own fate thanks to you.<br>
Hardin controlled the missing piece of my memory, but now it's complete.<br1>
He no longer has any influence over me!<br>
I feel I got back my <font color="LEVEL">real self</font>.<br1>
For that I am eternally grateful. That's what I wanted to say.<br>
