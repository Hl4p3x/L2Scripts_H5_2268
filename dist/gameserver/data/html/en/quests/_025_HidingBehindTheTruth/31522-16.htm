Mysterious Wizard:<br>
A group is only as strong as the individuals in it.<br1>
Anyone can talk with the leader of a group, just like you're talking to me.<br1>
Don't forget that.<br>
Lidia asked me to give you this as a token of thanks,<br1>
and since you helped with my experiment,<br1>
I have something for you as well.<br1>
Use it well until it's time for you to decide.
