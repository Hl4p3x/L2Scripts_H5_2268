High Priest Agripel:<br>
Don't be angry with me!<br1>
No matter how much power a Mystic possesses, he can't fight the great powers that move this world.<br>
You know everything that happened in the Forest of the Dead.<br1>
Perhaps you know something that I don't.<br>

Truth alone cannot change the balance of power!<br>
