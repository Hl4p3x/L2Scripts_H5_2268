Mysterious Wizard:<br>
I was preparing my magic.<br1>
It's not easy to conjure an army without corpses,<br1>
so I opened the door to the netherworld to steal the army of shillien.<br>
While I was preparing,<br1>
Lidia took Rose's corpse.<br1>
You know the story from there.<br1>
I conjured Triol, and Triol made Lidia the Lord of the Forest of the Dead.<br1>
In the meantime, I started some experiments.<br>
