Commander Kbaldir:<br>
Like the other Seeds that have floated into Gracia, the easiest, and right now, only way to get to the Seed of Annihilation is by <font color="LEVEL">flight</font>. You either need access to an airship or know the Aura Bird Transformation.<br>
If you don't have an airship, the Dwarf they call <font color="LEVEL">Engineer Lekon</font> below is who you should talk to. <font color="LEVEL">Officer Tolonis</font> might also sell you one. As for the Aura Bird Transformation, I couldn't tell you how to learn it, I honestly don't know.<br>
