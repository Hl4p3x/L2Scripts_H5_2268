Researcher Lorain:<br>
Good to see you! I tried to reconstruct these broken metal pieces, but it's beyond my skill. I think we must ask <font color="LEVEL">Nikola</font> for help -- he knows a lot of people, one of whom may be able to repair this. I know I should probably visit him myself, but I'm still a litle worried about the argument we had before. Would you help me?<br>
