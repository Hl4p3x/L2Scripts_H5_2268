Blacksmith Altran:<br>
So, Sorcerer Harris sent you. He asked me to make strong tools that would not rust. Even if I could make saws and nails from damascus metal, hammers must be made from a lighter, harder material.<br>
I'm thinking of taking this opportunity to make a new tool that I've only been thinking of. To make that, I need a slightly <font color="LEVEL">exotic material</font>. Could you help me in finding it?<br>
