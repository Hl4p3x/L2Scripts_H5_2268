Pixie Murika:<br>
A few days ago, the king of the birds came to my race and asked for help. <font color="LEVEL">Keltirs</font> steal water birds' eggs hidden in the grass, while the <font color="LEVEL">wolves</font> devour baby pheasants, and he asked us to slay the greedy animals for him.<br>
It is true that the <font color="LEVEL">keltir</font> and the <font color="LEVEL">wolf</font> only act on their inbred natural instincts, but we must stop them from preying on the birds for a time, if we are to restore the balance of the forest! Right now our queen is thinking of ways to protect the birds of the forest. Surely with her insight and wisdom, she will find an excellent solution!<br>
