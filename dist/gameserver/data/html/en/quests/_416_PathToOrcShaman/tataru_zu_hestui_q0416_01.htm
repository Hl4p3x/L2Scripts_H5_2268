Tataru Zu Hestui:<br>
An Orc Mystic acts as an intermediary between this world and the spirit world, supplicating the spirits for the power to command nature. That is how we breathe power into our allies and cure even the most grievous wounds of battle. Even our enemies quake before this mighty power!<br>
