Alright! The mission is to hunt down those wicked monsters in field of reeds. They are the biggest obstacle in our plan to turn this area into a development zone.<br>
Those monsters are the <font color="LEVEL">Mucrokian Fanatic, Mucrokian Ascetic, Mucrokian Savior, Mucrokian Preacher, and Contaminated Mucrokian</font>. Also, the <font color="LEVEL">Mutated Mucrokians</font> are those who were awakened by the plot of the Purified Ceremony Hall.
 They are fiercely violent. Since they are the worst obstacle, I will give you twice the reward.<br>
Please don't show them any mercy!
