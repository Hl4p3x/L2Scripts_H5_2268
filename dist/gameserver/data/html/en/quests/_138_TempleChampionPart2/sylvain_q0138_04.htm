High Priest Sylvain:<br>
Thanks to your efforts, we were able to recreate the missing inspector's report.<br>
Based on his findings, we have written a manifesto showing that the advent of the angel proves the authority and legitimacy of the Temple.<br>
We wish to distribute this document to the groups who have broken ties with us.<br>
