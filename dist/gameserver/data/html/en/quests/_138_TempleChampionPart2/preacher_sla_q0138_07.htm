According to my studies, there is a distinct possibility that Einhasad is not the creator of the Humans after all...<br>
I have uncovered certain ancient sources that predate the Elmoreden period and survived Emperor Shunaiman's purges. They suggest that humanity was in fact created in another fashion altogether.<br>
In my opinion, the Humans who conquered this continent needed a myth in order to dignify themselves and secure their control over the empire...<br>
The Temple of Einhasad was accordingly formed chiefly for political reasons.<br>
Think about it. It certainly explains why the Temple has fostered such an intimate relationship with the Rulers of Dawn, the ones with secular power.<br>
