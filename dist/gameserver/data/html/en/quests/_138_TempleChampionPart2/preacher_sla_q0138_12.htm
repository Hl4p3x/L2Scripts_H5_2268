Preacher Sla:<br>
I can see you're confused...<br>
That's understandable, but take care that you don't lose faith! Remember that the healing power of Einhasad is everywhere, regardless of rank or race.<br>
I don't know what happened between Einhasad and Emperor Shunaiman, but...<br>
I refuse to believe that the goddess is somehow in error -- it must be those mortals who pervert her good name for their own advancement that are to blame.<br>
Now go tell <font color="LEVEL">High Priest Sylvain</font> what I just told you!
