Atuba Chief Varkees:<br>
Dekara Lamchar Kakai! All praise the great Lord Kakai, Lord of the Flame of Paagrio! 
I see by the necklace you wear that you seek the Lord's judgment! Excellent! <br>
I, Varkees, chief of the Atubas, will share my knowledge with you. Tribes require symbols to rally around.  Each tribe has their own symbol known as a totem.  Once you understand the power that the totem gives to the Atuba fighters, your skills will identify you as their Lord.<br>
