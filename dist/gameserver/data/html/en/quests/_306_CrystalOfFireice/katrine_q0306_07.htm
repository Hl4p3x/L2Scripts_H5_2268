Trader Katerina:<br>
Thank you very much. I think I can feel a warmth at the tip of my fingers because the jewel contains the power of the spirits. How fascinating.<br>
As I promised, I will compensate you according to the number of jewels you brought me. Will you go back to the ruins to bring more jewels? Or do you want to end our Contract?<br>
