Trader Katerina:<br>
Although I work as a merchant now, my specialty used to be collecting and dealing in jewels. I would ask travelers like you to obtain rare jewels, and I would sell them at Giran or Aden. A little while ago, I found some entertaining information while looking through some ancient documents at the School of Wizardry. The <font color="LEVEL">Stones of Water and Fire</font> that were once used by the ancient Elf magicians could be found some place on this island. It was a long-abandoned place called the <font color="LEVEL">Elven Ruins.</font> Sound interesting to you?<br>
The Elven Ruins are much too dangerous for someone like me, but I'm sure you can handle it without a problem. If you bring back the jewels that I'm looking for from the ruins, I'll pay you generously. How about it?<br>
