Hermit:<br>
You've passed the first test. You've already come further than most who've attempted it! You're really starting to look like the hero I've been waiting for!<br1>
Further dangers await you, however...<br1>
You must always try to keep your cool.<br1>
Take this Stone of Commune to the Tablet of Vision in the northern part of the Varka Silenos stronghold. You'll get further instruction from the Tablet of Vision.
