Priest Kanis:<br>
They say that a monster named <font color="LEVEL">Baylor</font> rules over the <font color="LEVEL">Water Dragon's Cave</font>.<br>
I believe that Baylor guards the place where the Shamaness is being held captive.<br>
If that is the case, you will only be able to reach the Shamaness by defeating Baylor.<br>
That creature is said to be far stronger and more frightening that ordinary monsters, so please be careful...<br>
