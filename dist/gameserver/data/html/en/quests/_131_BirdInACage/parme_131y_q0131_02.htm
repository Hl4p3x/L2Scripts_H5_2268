Water Dragon's Shamaness Parme:<br>
(Suddenly, an ethereal and sorrowful melody begins to flow from the Echo Crystal you received from Kanis.<br>
The Shamaness' body is engulfed in light, and her eyes come back into focus as she clutches her head and shrieks in pain.<br>
A moment later...<br>
She seems to recover, although still appears somewhat disoriented.)<br>
Wh...who...are you?<br>
And where... am I?<br>
