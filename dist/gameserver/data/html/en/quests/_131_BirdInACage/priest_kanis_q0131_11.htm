Priest Kanis:<br>
I was able to determine the Shamaness' location by using a relic of Eva that contains the power of the Water Dragon.<br>
...<br>
Take this Echo Crystal for now.<br>
When I confirmed her location through the relic, I was also able to ascertain a little about her condition.<br>
It seems that her mind has been sealed in order to block her from communicating with the Water Dragon.<br>
When you find her, you may need this Echo Crystal, which contains the voice of her mother, also a famous priestess.<br>
