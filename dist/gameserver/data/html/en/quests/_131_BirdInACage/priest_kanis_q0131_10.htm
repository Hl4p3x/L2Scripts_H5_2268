Priest Kanis:<br>
Considering all that has happened, it is clear to me that some evil force is trying to use the Shamaness to obtain the Water Dragon's power.<br>
It must have disguised itself as a hurt, weak creature and entered the most vulnerable part of the Shamaness' mind.<br>
By the time the Shamaness realized that something was wrong, the evil force had managed to obtain nearly all of the Water Dragon's power.<br>
If the Shamaness were restored the her own mind, it would undoubtedly feel the wrath of the Water Dragon...<br>
The evil force realized this and acted first by attacking the Crystal Oracle and imprisoning the Shamaness some place she cannot communicate with the Water Dragon.<br>
