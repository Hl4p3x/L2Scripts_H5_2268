Beast Herder Tunatun:<br>
Buy food from the Feed Sellers. Without food the beasts turn feral. If that happens you've wasted everyone's time. So do us both a favor, have enough food ready.<br>
The cubs you can raise are <font color="LEVEL">Alpine Buffalo, Alpine Grendel, Alpine Kookaburra, and Alpine Cougar</font>. So raise em' right. And when you do... bring me a Jewel of Innocence!
