Grand Master Tobias:<br>
Both the Preachers of the Wilderness and the Revolutionaries of Dusk heard the sounds of the angel crying for help.<br>
She seems to be injured and fleeing something very powerful.<br>
Now that we know where she is, we must offer what aid we can.<br>
Go find <font color="LEVEL">Elder Casian</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Wasteland</font> and ask him for the necessary medicine.<br>
If you give him the Prophecy, he will be able to tell you the angel's exact location.<br>
Then go heal her and bring me her message in an Echo Crystal.<br>
Casian will be able to tell you more.
