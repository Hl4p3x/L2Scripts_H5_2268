Fallen Angel:<br>
I understand your confusion, but what I have told you is the truth... I wish I could explain it more fully to you, but I must not risk being discovered by Mother in this place or my mission will be a failure.<br>
Perhaps we will meet again, in a different place, at a different time.<br>
Thank you for your assistance -- I shall not forget it.<br>
Until we meet again, may the light of heaven shine on you and through you...
