Fallen Angel:<br>
In a way, Shilen is also a victim...<br>
 Why has Mother not used her great power to restore things to their natural order?
 Why has Gran Kain, that trouble-making lover of chaos, become a father figure to the gods?

 I cannot understand this.
 Perhaps that is why I could not become a goddess...<br>
