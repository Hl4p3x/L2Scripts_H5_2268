Elder Casian:
Then take this healing medicine...<br>
Making it was extremely difficult, since the angel is not a living creature born of this world. Many of my brethren sacrificed much to gather the materials I needed to create this.<br>
Take good care of it, and speed it to the angel as quickly as you can!<br>
