Elder Casian:<br>
To find the fallen angel, climb to the <font color="LEVEL">Weathered Rock</font> in the wilderness and sing a song of praise from the prophecy.<br>
Once the medicine has done its work, you will be able to speak with the angel.
I have marked the location of the Weathered Rock on your map, adventurer.
Good luck!
