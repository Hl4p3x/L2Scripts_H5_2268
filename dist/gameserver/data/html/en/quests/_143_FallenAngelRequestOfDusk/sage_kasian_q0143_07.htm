Elder Casian:<br>
Perhaps you are -- now.
But your encounter with the angel may change you...
Because the strong grow stronger and the weak become weaker, this world is waiting for a hero who is unafraid to speak truth to power and who will face the coming darkness without flinching.
Whether that is you, I cannot say. But I pray that that person appears soon -- for all our sakes.<br>
