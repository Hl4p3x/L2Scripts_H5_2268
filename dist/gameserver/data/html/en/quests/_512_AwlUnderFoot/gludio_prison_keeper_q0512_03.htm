Prison Warden:<br>
Excellent! I appreciate your offer, friend.<br>
This dungeon prison was only recently discovered, and no one knows its true purpose.<br>
Some legends say that some emperor long, long ago created this dungeon as a place to secretly breed monsters for magical experiments.<br>
Others say that it was build during the empire's golden age to contain monsters that were pitted against prisoners in gladiatorial fights.<br>
Whatever its purpose, it was sealed and hidden for centuries -- we only recently uncovered the entrance.<br>
Well, let's get down to brass tacks. Please defeat the leaders of <font color="LEVEL">three prisoner gangs</font> that roam the dungeon, <font color="LEVEL">Beautiful Atrielle, Nagen the Tomboy and Jax the Destroyer</font>, and bring me the monsters' rank badges.<br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 512 gludio_prison_keeper_q0512_11.htm">Understood. I will start immediately</a><br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 512 gludio_prison_keeper_q0512_04.htm">Can you tell me more about the monsters in the dungeon?</a>
