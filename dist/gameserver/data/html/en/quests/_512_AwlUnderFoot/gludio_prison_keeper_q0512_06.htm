Prison Warden:<br>
Long ago, there was a great battle between monsters and a large punitive force.<br>
What a fight that was...<br>
Both sides suffered enormous casualties.<br>
In its aftermath, however, the monsters became more cautious in their movements.<br>
But recently we have observed 3 powerful gangs of monster ex-prisoners.<br>
They are up to something, that's for sure.<br>
Your task is to slay all 3 gangs and destroy the monsters' organization in the dungeon.<br>
When you defeat the leader of the last gang, bring me a <font color="LEVEL">piece of the monster's rank badge</font> and I will repay you with the Knight's Epaulette, which you can exchange with the  palace's magician for the castle's clan supply.<br>
Ah, one last thing...<br>
The rumored leaders of the monsters are <font color="LEVEL">Beautiful Atrielle, Nagen the Tomboy and Jax the Destroyer</font>.<br>
I can grant you access to the dungeon right now.<br>
Good luck!
