Tablet of Vision:<br>
Further communion with this tablet would be futile. The next Stone of Commune is near the Tablet of Vision that can be found south of Hunters Village.<br1>
 I remember the sweet whisper of temptation from the demon. A song with irresistible magic and no audience to listen to it.<br1>
Find the next tablet now.
