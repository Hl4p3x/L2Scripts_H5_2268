Oh yeah, great song, buddy!<br1>
You passed the test! You know, a while back, a lady wearing a blue dress appeared to me in a dream!<br1>
She said that soon I'd be visited by a singer seeking a test. She told me I should do it.<br1>
Do you know the test? It was respect! To pass the test, the person would do as I asked, no matter how rude my manner was. And, he would sing a song with a sincere heart...<br1>
Here is the Stone of Commune. Take it with you to the Tablet of Vision. The first tablet can be found in the south part of the Tower of Insolence.<br1>
I'll pray that your song becomes popular! Oh, and thanks for the beer! Ha! Good luck!
