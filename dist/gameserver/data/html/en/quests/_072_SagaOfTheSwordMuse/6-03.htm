Tablet of Vision:<br>
Countless thoughts beyond comprehension sear painfully into your brain. You hear the faint whisper of a woman's voice.<br1>
You see a vision of a male Elf, singing to thunderous applause!<br1>
You once read about him in a book called* "Critique of Biel's Song"*.<br1>
Could he have the next Stone of Commune?<br1>
He's waiting at the next Tablet of Vision, in the northeast corner of the Ketra Orc Outpost!
