Guard Beltkam:<br>
I lost my whole family to <font color="LEVEL">Antharas the Land Dragon.</font> My mother and younger sister perished ten years ago, when many southern villages in Giran burned to the ground in the heat of Antharas' rampage. Then, three years ago, when the land dragon extermination force was formed at the lord's command, my father and older brother were recruited as soldiers, sent to the Dragon Valley, and eventually died meaningless deaths.<br>
I swore an oath before my family graves that I would slay that great evil creature. Everyone holds me back, saying that it is a futile effort, but I will definitely bring Antharas down. Don't you think that's the only way to bring peace to the spirits of my family?<br>
I have prepared diligently during this past year for my revenge. I consulted with many mercenaries, and I even researched documents relating to the dragon in the Ivory Tower's library. The dwarf bounty hunter "Terrin Wymslayer," who is a famous dragon hunter, especially gave me many words of advice. I finally came to the conclusion that <font color="LEVEL">arrows</font> were the most effective weapons.<br>
For the past six months, I have repledged my oath of revenge every day, while working to forge an arrow that will kill Antharas. But the ingredients needed to create the arrow are all difficult to obtain. That is why I must frequently ask travelers like you to collect these ingredients for me. Can I also ask this favor of you?<br>
