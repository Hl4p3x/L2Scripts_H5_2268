Guard Belton:<br>
You've come back empty-handed. Did you not promise to bring me harpy's <font color="LEVEL">Silver Feathers, the teeth of a wyrm</font> and the <font color="LEVEL">venom of a medusa</font>?<br>
As soon as you obtain these three materials, bring them to me. I will reward you for each that you bring back. I've inherited quite a fortune from my deceased parents, so don't worry about the reward.  Please don't quit, help me.<br>

<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 331 beltkem_q0331_07.htm">Say you will collect the materials</a>
