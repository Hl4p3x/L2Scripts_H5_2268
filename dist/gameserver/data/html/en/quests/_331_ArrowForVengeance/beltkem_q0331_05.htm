Guard Belton:<br>
I'm feeling an exceptionally strong longing for my family today. But I cannot risk falling into my fancies and having my determination shaken or my will for revenge weakened. Every day as I make arrows, sharpen the teeth of the worms, and put feathers on my arrows, I think of my dead family. And as I apply the poison of the medusa on the end of the arrowhead, I curse Antaras.<br>
Now, shall we take a look at the materials you have brought? Good. This should be enough material to make arrows for a few days. As promised, I will reward you according to the number of materials you have brought me. This should be enough, I presume? If you are not planning to leave any time soon, could you help me some more? I beg you!<br>
