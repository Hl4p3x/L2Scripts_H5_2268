Nameless Spirit:<br>
Don't worry! Show your <font color="LEVEL">used sepulcher pass</font> to the <font color="LEVEL">ghost of Elmoreden's chamberlain</font> at the Pilgrim's Temple. She'll teleport you here again. The pass will let her know that you've been here before. You can find another <font color="LEVEL">ghost of Elmoreden's chamberlain</font> near the gate of the Wall of Argos.<br>
Well, you got all that? What do you think? Will you help me?<br>
