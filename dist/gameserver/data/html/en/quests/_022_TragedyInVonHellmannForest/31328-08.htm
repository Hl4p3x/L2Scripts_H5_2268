Innocentin:<br>
Indeed! Is this the box he told you about?<br1>
He told me once, in case something happened to him, he would store all his most important documents in a box! Hmm...<br1>
I can't help but think... Perhaps it's fortunate that I left the temple and came here! Ah... but that's not important...<br1>
Now give me the box!<br1>
I must open it carefully and see what it holds. Why don't you come back a little later?
