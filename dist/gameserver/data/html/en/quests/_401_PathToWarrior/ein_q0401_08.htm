Master Auron:<br>
So you've met <font color="LEVEL">Simplon</font>? I see he has given you a difficult task. The <font color="LEVEL">sword of trial</font> is not given to just anyone, you know. But don't think too harshly of <font color="LEVEL">Simplon</font> -- he may seem stern on the outside, but really he's a fine friend once you get to know him.
