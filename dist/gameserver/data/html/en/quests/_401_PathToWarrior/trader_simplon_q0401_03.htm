Trader Simplon:<br>
What? Why have you returned empty handed? Do you not wish to become a <font color="LEVEL">Warrior</font>, or are you stupid? If you have forgotten already, let me tell you again! Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Ruins of Despair</font> and fight the tracker skeletons, collect ten of their <font color="LEVEL">rusted swords</font>, and bring them to me.
