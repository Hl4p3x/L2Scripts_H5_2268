Master Auron:<br>
Good, so you have found the sword of trial. Here's what you must do now ... If you go out to the wilderness, you will find poison spiders -- their bodies are bigger than wagons, and they're violent and dangerous to deal with. Use only the rusty <font color="LEVEL">bronze sword</font> to hunt the <font color="LEVEL">poison spiders</font>. You may not use any other weapons.<br>
When you kill a poison spider, cut off its legs and keep  them. Ah yes, and you may also bring the legs of the <font color="LEVEL">trimden</font>, a spider which is a little more ferocious even than the poison spider. Collect <font color="LEVEL">twenty spider legs</font> and bring them here. That is the test to become a <font color="LEVEL">Warrior</font>. If you pass this test, I will give you the medallion of the <font color="LEVEL">Warrior</font>.<br>
