Master Auron:<br>
How do you hunt a <font color="LEVEL">poison spider</font> with a <font color="LEVEL">rusty sword</font>? Look here, fellow, do you know what the creed of our warriors guild is? It's stay alive even in the worst conditions*. There is no law that says you will always be at an advantage in a fight against your opponent. However, in any situation, you can win if you keep your wits about you.<br>
Think of this ... do you think a knight armed with <font color="LEVEL">luxurious steel armor</font> and a <font color="LEVEL">steel sword</font> has achieved a real victory after killing a farmer who is armed with a <font color="LEVEL">wooden spear</font>? True victory is rolling in the mud and taking a beating, then picking up a stone and striking for your opponent's head. It is that gruesome. Do you understand what I'm saying?<br>
