Master Auron:<br>
Now I'm a master who teaches young Fighters, but I was once a soldier for the <font color="LEVEL">Warrior League</font>, walking the borderline between of life and death on the battlefield.<br>
To be accepted into the <font color="LEVEL">Warrior League</font>, there's no need for a noble birth or the lord's recommendation. We accept any Fighter who has courage and spirit.<br>
