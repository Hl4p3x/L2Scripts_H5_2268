What? Are you trying to become a <font color="LEVEL">Warrior</font>? Ha ha! To me, you seem like a novice! Well, now that I think of it, when I was young the elder soldiers would often look down on me because I had a childlike face. So I will give you an opportunity.<br>
Well, if you want to be a <font color="LEVEL">Warrior</font>, you must first find the <font color="LEVEL">sword of trial</font>. I already know where it is, but first let me test your disposition.<br>
