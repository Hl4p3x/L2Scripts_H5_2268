So, how do you like the <font color="LEVEL">sword of trial</font> that I gave you? By the way, why are you still staying in this village? Go along to <font color="LEVEL">Master Auron</font> and show him the letter that I wrote. Then he will tell you about the test you must take with the sword of trial to become a <font color="LEVEL">Warrior</font>.
