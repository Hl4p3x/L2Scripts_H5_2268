Head Researcher Sobling:<br>
So Cliff sent us this dictionary, i can see clearly now.
 It's very impressive...
 There are more relics for we to find out and maybe you will help us as a future member of our excavation team.
 We should look for <font color="LEVEL">The book of the Titan's science, and the Book of the Titan's Culture.</font><br>
Our payment for such a discovery cannot be rejected so easily, <font color="LEVEL">A grade recipes</font> used in the manufacture of top level armors...
 Of course i won't give you anything just for fragments, you will have to gather every piece of a given book.<br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 377 yes">I will search for ancient books</a><br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 377 0">I won't help you this time</a>
