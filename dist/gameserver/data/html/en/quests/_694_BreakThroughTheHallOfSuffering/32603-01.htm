Officer Tepios:<br>
When the Seed first revealed its magic power, the power of the Barrier allowed us to defend Keucereus Alliance Base. But this region was too close to the source of the magic, and there was no defense possible. Then those who had not fled degenerated into undead. That is the origin of the 2 Death Knightts who keep the Hall of Suffering. Although they are now <font color="LEVEL">Yehan Kodekusm the Soul Destroyer</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Yehan Klanikus, the Guide of Darkness</font>, they were once famous twin knights. In life they were fierce rivals, but now they share a unique bond. You must kill them both -- if only one is slain, he will be resurrected by his twin. Can you help us?<br>
