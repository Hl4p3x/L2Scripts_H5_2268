Hierarch Asterios:<br>
This ...! The undead you came across at the water source are called <font color="LEVEL">plague zombies</font>, and are those creatures who were killed by plagues and that have been resurrected with black magic. The fine powder that falls from their decomposing bodies is this <font color="LEVEL">plague dust</font> ... This is the substance that has been polluting our water. You would have been infected by the plague if you had not taken the hyacinth charm ...<br>
Hmm ... This is definitely the doing of the <font color="LEVEL">Dark Elves</font>! They cannot be forgiven! But first, we must revive the dying <font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree</font>. To do that, we must purify the polluted waters ...<br>
I will need more <font color="LEVEL">plague dust</font> to research a purification spell. Please go back to the water source and obtain this cursed powder for me. I need at least <font color="LEVEL">five handfuls</font>.
