Well done! The truth is, my letter was mixed in
with the items in the box.<br>
Wehn i saw someone pursuing these goods, I
decided to follow, but i was a little late getting
here. Thankfully, you drove them away and i was
able to protect the secret. Thank you for your
assistance you have done more than you
realize. Here, please take this to the Elder.<br>
