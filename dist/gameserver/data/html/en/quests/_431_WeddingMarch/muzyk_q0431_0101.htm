Melody Maestro Kantabilon:<br>
Great news! I found the musical score for a wedding march I've been searching for!<br>
Now I can play for all the lucky couples in the world!<br>
I need a special Echo Crystal to store this music.<br>
Bring me <font color="LEVEL">50 Silver Crystals</font>, and I'll fill half of them with music for you!<br>
