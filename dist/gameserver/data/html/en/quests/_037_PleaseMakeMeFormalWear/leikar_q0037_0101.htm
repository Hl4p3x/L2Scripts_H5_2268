Hello! What can I do for you?<br>
Formal Wear? I'm sorry, but I need to run an errand now. I'll be gone for quite a while...<br>
Don't make that face! Hmm...I have an idea! Will you help me?<br>
I need to run an errand that will take a while. If you do it for me, I'll start the preparations for your Formal Wear.<br>
