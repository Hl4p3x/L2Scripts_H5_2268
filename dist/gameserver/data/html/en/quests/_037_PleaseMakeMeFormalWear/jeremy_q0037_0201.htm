Chef Jeremy:<br>
What brings you here? Can't you see how busy I am?<br>
You're here for the cookies?<br>
Let me see the stamp of the person who ordered it. Ah, you're here for Leikar! You're early! They're not ready yet.<br>
Don't rush me. I've got an idea, why don't you help me? They'll be ready much quicker...<br>
