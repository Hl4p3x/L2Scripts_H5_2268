Magister Kaira:<br>
Our task is to discover the hidden facts, and reveal the truth. The Dark Elves have the shortest history and are the fewest in number among the 5 races, but we understand the power of darkness better than anybody else. We explore and manage without fear the very thing that other tribes fears, the power of darkness, the ultimate secrets veiled under the abyss of darkness.... This is our strength.<br>
We strongly believe that the more we uncover the truth and reveal hidden knowledge, the stronger we will become. If you wish to proceed to a higher level, you must achieve more knowledge and truth.<br>
(Quest for Dark Elven characters level 37 or above.)
