Warehouse Keeper Dorankus:<br>
Ah! You're here for the item that Undrias entrusted to me? Here it is! <font color="LEVEL">Dreviant wine</font>, made from the poison of spiders. A rare wine that even I have never tasted. He gave it to me a year ago, and now he asks for it! I guess he stored it away in safekeeping for this year's mass.
