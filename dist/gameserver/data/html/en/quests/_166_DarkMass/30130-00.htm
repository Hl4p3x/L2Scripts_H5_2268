Abyssal Celebrant Undrias:<br>
Soon we will hold the <font color="LEVEL">mass of darkness</font> in honor of <font color="LEVEL">Gran Kain</font> of the darkness and Shilen, the mother of the abyss. This mass is the most sacred religious ceremony of our race. The clergy of the sanctuary are very busy with preparations. We are suffering from lack of help, but I cannot possibly ask a favor of our guests!<br>
