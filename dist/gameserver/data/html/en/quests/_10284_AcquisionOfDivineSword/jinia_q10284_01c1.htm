Yesâ€¦ that was a tragedy. We thought Princess Felicia existed somewhere within the Ice Queen's mind. However, when Kier tried to convince her to give up her power and sway her from evil, she turned him to ice. I fear Felicia may be gone forever and now there is only Freya.<br>
Our mission to turn Felicia back has changed over the years - no longer is it a mission to save Felicia, but to save the world from the destructive might of the Ice Queen by killing her once and for all.<br>
