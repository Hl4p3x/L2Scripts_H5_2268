No, you do NOT get it you amateur. Part 3 is the most important part of the challenge.Â It separates the no talent wannabes from the pros.<br>
You must score <font color="LEVEL">Over-hits on fully grown Alpine animals</font>. A kill is a kill and that is all fine and dandy, but we are looking for perfection here. Bonus points are scored for performing <font color="LEVEL">Critical Over-hits</font>.<br>
Do you understand the challenge?<br>
