Really... you really want me to go over this again? It is simple. Find an <font color="LEVEL">Alpine Kookaburra, Alpine Cougar, Alpine Buffalo, or Alpine Grendel</font> and feed it on spice until it grows into an adult. Speak to my associate over here to purchase spice.<br>
Once it is an adult, kill it trying to score as many <font color="LEVEL">Over-hits and Critical Over-hits</font> as possible.<br>
The limit is <font color="LEVEL">10 of each</font> type of animal. That's a total of 40 if you can't add. If you can't score an Over-hit before killing an animal, you'll have to wait until tomorrow to try again.<br>
Do you think you can follow these directions?<br>
