Bard Swan:<br>
Please get some black beer from <font color="LEVEL">Chef Jonas</font> and take it to <font color="LEVEL">Trader Sabrin</font>. <font color="LEVEL">Jonas</font> keeps his beer in a <font color="LEVEL">beer chest</font> and stores it in a warehouse... He becomes quite cross when asked for favors, so it would be best if you 
handled this without talking to him.<br>
Also, go to the grocery store in the village and find a <font color="LEVEL">clothes chest</font>. You will find it near <font color="LEVEL">Trader Sonia</font>. Take the contents of that chest to <font color="LEVEL">Guard Xaber</font>. Here are the keys to the two chests. Good luck!
