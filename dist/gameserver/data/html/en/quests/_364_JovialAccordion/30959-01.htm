Musician Barbado:<br>
Some time ago, I heard <font color="LEVEL">Bard Swan</font> playing his mandolin. His skills are quite impressive. I wish he would play a duet with me, but for some reason, whenever he sees me he avoids me...<br>
I hate to ask you to do this, but would you go see <font color="LEVEL">Swan</font> and tell him that I want to play a duet with him? Of course you will be rewarded for your effort.<br>
