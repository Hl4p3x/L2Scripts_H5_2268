Inspector Sinai:<br>
Please defeat those chaotic Spirites in the temple and restore stability.<br>
You may use this Spirite's Sword, forged with both the power of water and fire. I know you will use it well.<br>
Also, take this book written by the Elves who built this place -- it will tell you if something is wrong with the temple. When you enter the temple, follow the book's instructions.<br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 128 32500-06.htm">Accept the sword and the book.</a>
