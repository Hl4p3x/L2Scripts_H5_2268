Inspector Adler:<br>
We really don't know what you will encounter when you open the gateway to Pailaka. But as with Kamaloka, I suspect you will find an ally there willing to share information.<br>
You should have no difficulty learning what you must do.<br>
Of course, you don't know what kind of weapons to take with you.. Be careful, though -- <font color="LEVEL">taking too many items may actually cause you to fail! Be careful</font><br>
And good luck!<br>
