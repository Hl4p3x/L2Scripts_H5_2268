Temple Inspector:<br>
The Spirite's Sword... Under normal caircumstances, that sword can stabilize the power of the Spirite -- but the current situation is beyond its ability alone.<br>
However, combined with the Essence of Water you have, we may have a chance. According to legend, when the sword can't stabilize the temple itself, the temple will actually find a wayto strenghen the sword. I suppose the legend must be true!<br>
Will you use the Essence of Water to strengthen the sword?<br>
