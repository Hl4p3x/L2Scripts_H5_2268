Maestro Reorin:<br>
Have you brought 984 B grade crystals? What wonderful timing! The temperature of the metal is just about right...<br>
Hmm, we're going to need another ingredient! The pure infernium is too soft... It must be combined with very pure mithril to make an alloy.<br>
High quality Mithril Ore is quite rare these days. It would be much easier to just melt a B grade item.<br>
*You must tell me now what kind of B grade weapon you will bring back! I'll prepare the melted infernium and set the ratio accordingly. Choose carefully!<br>
Also, if you throw a weapon into a furnace, its enchantment and special capabilities will disappear. Please bear this in mind!*<br>
