Trader Mion:<br>
Aghhh! What are you doing here? Hey ... I don't have time ... Just spin the silk out of them. If I don't have twenty dresses by next week, I will be kicked out of the Silver Scale Guild!<br>
I am telling you once more. You may receive spider silks only by hunting <font color="LEVEL">crimson tarantulas</font>, <font color="LEVEL">hunter tarantulas</font> or <font color="LEVEL">plunder tarantulas</font>. Just find them quickly and I will pay you back for sure. Also, you may only spin silks by giving <font color="LEVEL">Defender Nathan</font> the* tarantula spinnerets*! You don't have much time! You should be busy hunting spiders now ... you shouldn't waste your time like this! Please hurry, hurry ... I'm about to cry ...*I don't know what to do now!*<br>
