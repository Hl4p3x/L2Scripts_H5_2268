O Ho Ho! Do you think I'm stupid? Do you think I'd ask just anyone to collect tarantula spider silk, which is easy to damage, just because I'm too busy!! Oh no ... I'm very upset! You are not even an apprentice of the Guild! You are bothering me, so go away! <font color="LEVEL">If you want to become an apprentice of the Guild, you should go to Elder Arin or Elder Keef at the House of Elders instead! Do you get it now?</font><br>
