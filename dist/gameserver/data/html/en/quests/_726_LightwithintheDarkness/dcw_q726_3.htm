Detention Camp Warden:<br>
Sure! If you wish, of course. We're glad to take help from any hands now. But I must warn you...<br>
There're 4 investigators trapped there. They're not weak, but without your help they are doomed. Pailaka is a dream, so we don't know what would happen of investigators will die. Your job is to hold <font color="LEVEL">3 waves of attack</font> and make sure all investigators are alive.<br>
You can't make it alone, so gather your friends and speak to me. We can't waste any moment longer!<br>
