Warehouse Keeper Randolf:<br>
Have you heard of the notorius pirate Zaken? His dogged pursuit of <font color="LEVEL">treasure</font> led him to a rockly island now called "Devil's Isle". His increasingly eccentric behavior caused him to lose the confidence of his crew, and they marooned him there.<br>
In despair, Zaken turned to the forces of darkness, who gave him power to kill and imprison the souls of all of those who betrayed him. Even now, the souls of thise damned warriors roam that barren place.<br>
I suppose you knew this already. But here is something you probably don't know... It is said that <font color="LEVEL">Zaken's treasure was stolen by his betrayers</font>, and they still have it! So what do you think? Will you help me find the treasure?<br>
