You've got some nerve addressing an elder like that! So, you want to broaden your horizons, eh? Ha! Even if you could afford to travel, Maphr couldn't keep you safe out there! I admire your courage and ambition, but it takes more than those things to travel, my friend! I'll tell you what!<br>
Pass a <font color="LEVEL">test</font> that I give you and I'll pay yourway to Giran. Do you understand?<br>
All I ask is that you obtain the endorsement of <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Chief Reed</font>. I must warn you, he's not easily impressed. Now get going!!!
