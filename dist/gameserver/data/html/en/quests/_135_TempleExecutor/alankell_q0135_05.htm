Alex:<br>
Recently, Grocer Pano has had financial difficulties and was forced to borrow a large sum of money. The person who lent him the money has agreed to forgive the debt entirely if Sonin brings him 10 Hate Crystals, which can be acquired from the monsters near Floran Village.<br>
As an adventurer, I am sure you know how dangerous a task that is. How could Grocer Pano possibly collect the Hate Crystals on his own?<br>
I have learned that the Hate Crystals can be obtained by hunting <font color="LEVEL">Delu Lizardman Suppliers, Special Agents, Commanders, Shaman and Cursed Seers</font>.<br>
If you catch them and give Grocer Pano <font color="LEVEL">10 Hate Crystals</font>, I know he will be happy to give you a letter of reference.<br>
