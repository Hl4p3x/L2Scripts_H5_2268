Chef Jeremy:<br>
The dish I shall make for the competition is called "Smoked Yeti." However, I cannot make it with ordinary Yeti meat; I need the meat from the Icicle Emperor, the greatest of all the Yeti.<br>
The Icicle Emperor ventures out only rarely, however, so we must first cook another meal as bait.<br>
I will require the stems of Hot Springs Nepenthes, feet of Hot Springs Bandersnatchlings, Hot Springs Atroxes and Hot Springs Atroxspawns. I need you to fetch me 50 Secret Spices derived from these materials.<br>
Why so many? Not only this particular Yeti very large, he is also a very discriminating eater. We must tease his palate...<br>
While you gather the spices, I will begun my preparations here. Hurry back!
