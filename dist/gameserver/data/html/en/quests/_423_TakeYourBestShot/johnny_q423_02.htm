Chief Investigator Johnny:<br>
You really want to see Ugoros? Just forget about it. Not just anyone can go there, and certainly not just any time they like. I know a guy, goes by Gatekeeper Batracos, a stinky meticulous fellow. He can get you to see the Seer. He'd never let in a gutterpup like you, but if he knew you had my respect, it might be a different story.<br>
