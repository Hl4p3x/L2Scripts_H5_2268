Chief Investigator Johnny:<br>
Okay. You're straightforward. I can dig.<br>
Like I said, you gotta defeat some <font color="LEVEL">Tanta Lizardmen Guards</font>, then go see <font color="LEVEL">Gatekeeper Batracos</font> and tell him that I sent you. He will bring you to see Tanta Seer Ugoros. You don't even gotta come back here if you don't want. Alright? Later.
