Thank you. Please help my poor fellow ghosts to rest in peace, even if only for a while...<br>
Some might share their <font color="LEVEL">dream fragments</font> with you as they expire, and they may be informative.<br>
If you give them peace, I will find some things among the keepsakes my friends left me that might be helpful to your quest and give them to you...<br>
Oh, but watch out for Nellis. He and his followers have gone completely mad. There is no getting through to them.
