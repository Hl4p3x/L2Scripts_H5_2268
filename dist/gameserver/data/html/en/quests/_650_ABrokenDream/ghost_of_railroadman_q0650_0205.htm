Ghost of the Railroad Engineer:<br>
Yes, I see. You have done enough. We should have realized that our dreams were foolish and unattainable. Sometimes we need an outsider to tell us when we've lost our perspective, when it's time to rest.<br>
Thank you. I wish you great blessings in your life of adventure.
