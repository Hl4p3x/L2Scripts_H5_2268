Grand Magister Fairen:<br>
The gods divided the power between the stones, and then buried and sealed them throughout the world. The stones are known as the* Tablets of Vision*. Absorb the knowledge from all* six* Tablets of Vision, and you'll become much stronger than you currently are. After you've done this, return to me and I'll make you a Storm Screamer! I must warn you... You've not chosen an easy path!<br1>
Are you sure you want to become a Storm Screamer?<br>
