Magister Kamilen:<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Stones of commune and Tablets of Vision have a magical mutual attraction. You can use this force to locate the Tablets of Vision</font>.<br1>
Put simply,* when you have a Stone of Commune, the location of the corresponding Tablet of Vision will appear in your mind. After you commune with it, the location of the next Stone of Commune will be revealed to you. This process will become clear to you as you move along*.<br1>
Now, take the first Stone of Commune I gave you and find the* Tablet of Vision south of the Tower of Insolence*!
