Magister Kamilen:<br>
Go to* the Ketra Orcs or the Varka Silenos* to get the* Divine Stone of Wisdom, a fragment of the Stone of Commune*.<br1>
They know of its powerful magic, but not its exact use. They'll reward the wisest of their tribe with it. You'll need to earn the trust of Asefa, chief shaman of the Ketra Orcs, or Udan Mardui, chief shaman of the Varka Silenos.<br1>
Which side will you choose?<br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 90 3-6">The Ketra Orcs</a><br1>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 90 3-7">The Varka Silenos</a>
