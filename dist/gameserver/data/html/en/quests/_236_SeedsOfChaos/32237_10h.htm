Rodenpicula:<br>
I will now break one of the restraints imposed upon you.<br>
This power was bequeathed to myself and Mother Nornil by the ancients. It will strengthen the <font color="LEVEL">Seed of Chaos</font> within you.<br>

I do know that it will definitely help you to break through the limitations that you sense. Do you wish to undergo the procedure?<br>
