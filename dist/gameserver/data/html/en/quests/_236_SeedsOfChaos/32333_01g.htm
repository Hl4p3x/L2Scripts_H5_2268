Katenar:<br>
Ah...<br>
If only time permitted, I would like to tell you everything...<br>
But it does not, unfortunately, and even now time is growing short. Are you familiar with the word <font color="LEVEL">"Spicula?"</font> Go ask one of my brethren, <font color="LEVEL">Harkilgamed</font> about it and listen to his reply...<br>
I can speak no more -- I must disappear now. Remember: <font color="LEVEL">Spicula Kamael</font><br>
You will find Harkilgamed hiding in the <font color="LEVEL">Valley of Saints</font>.<br>
