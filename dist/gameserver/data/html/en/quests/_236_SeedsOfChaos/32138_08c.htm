Heirarch Kekropus:<br>
On the other hand, we Kamael are limited in our birth and destiny.<br>
We may only wield the sword; we do not have a god so we cannot use holy powers, nor can we sing the song of magic...<br>
You younger Kamael have a few more options, but not many. Why is it that only the women have the ability to protect, while only the men have the ability to wield a sword?<br>
