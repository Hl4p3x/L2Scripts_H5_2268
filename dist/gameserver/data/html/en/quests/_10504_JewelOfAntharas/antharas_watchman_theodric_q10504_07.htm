<html><body>Watcher of Antharas Theodric:<br>
Amazing! I congratulate you on your accomplishment!<br>
The crystal is filled with the energy of the land dragon.<br>
You have brought back the land dragon's energy.<br>
Alas... this victory is short lived. Though Antharas has been defeated and we may celebrate peace for now... the land dragon will return some day. <br>
As always, I shall sit here and wait for that time to come. And when it does I await your return to vanquish the land dragon again. Please, take this... it should help you when the time comes again.
