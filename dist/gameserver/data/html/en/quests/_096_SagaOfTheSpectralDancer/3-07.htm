This is a broken Stone of Commune, useless without one of the fragments that was chipped off. Find a fragment, called a* Divine Stone of Wisdom*, from either the Ketra Orcs or the Varka Silenos. You must gain the trust of the chief shaman from either tribe. They'll reward it to the one who is most trustworthy. They believe it holds great magical power, but don't know its nature.<br1>
