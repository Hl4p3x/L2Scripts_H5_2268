Tablet of Vision:<br>
Suddenly, a vast amount of knowledge is painfully seared into your brain. The cascade of brief images is unintelligible at first...<br1>
 As the pain slowly ebbs, you feel dizzy and begin to visualize a new place. It seems as though it might be in the southeast of Ketra Orc Outpost. Around a tablet I can see Hallate's Dancer Lillian as Mordred warned. I can also sense the power of the Stone of Commune eminating from her. As I try to look deeper, my vision slowly comes back to normal.<br1>
The tablet goes still and dark, as if nothing had happened. I know now that I must find the Tablet of Vision in* the Southeast of Ketra Orc Outpost*!
