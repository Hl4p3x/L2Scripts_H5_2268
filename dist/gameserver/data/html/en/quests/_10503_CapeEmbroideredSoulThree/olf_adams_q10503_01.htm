Recently our guild of weavers invented a new way of processing tissues. We can weave into the fabric of clothes spirit monster.<br>
Such clothing is much stronger than usual, to the same, costume design is very original - it is given the similarity with the corresponding monster.<br>
If you are able to collect and bring me the spirit boss-monsters, I will prepare you a new cloak. Want to test your skills?<br>
