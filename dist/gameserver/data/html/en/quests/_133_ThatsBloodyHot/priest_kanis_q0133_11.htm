Priest Kanis:<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Galate</font> requested a sample of the manufactured crystal that can only be made by the priests of the Crystal Oracle.<br>
The manufactured crystal sample seems to be one of the special ingredients that she needs.<br>
Since you also seem to be interested in Hellbound Island, I am sure that if you deliver this manufactured crystal sample to <font color="LEVEL">Galate</font> and ask her about the method for reaching Hellbound Island, she will help you.<br>
