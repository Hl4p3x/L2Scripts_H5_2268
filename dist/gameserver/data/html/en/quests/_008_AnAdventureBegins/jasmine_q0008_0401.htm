Gatekeeper Jasmine:<br>
I'm afraid Giran may be too much for you right now. I can't send you there from here.<br>
If you insist on going there, take this <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Traveler</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Scroll of Escape to Giran Castle Town</font>.<br>
The magic scroll allows you to instantaneously travel to <font color="LEVEL">Giran</font>, but remember, it only works once. Use it wisely. When you're read to return, take the <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Traveler</font> to <font color="LEVEL">Galladucci</font> at his boutique. He'll help you.<br>
Among all the Human cities, <font color="LEVEL">Giran</font> is, by far, the loudest and most violent. Watch your back and have a safe trip!
