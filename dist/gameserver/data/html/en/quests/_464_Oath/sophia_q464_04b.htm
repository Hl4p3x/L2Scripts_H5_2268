Library of Sages Director Sophia:<br>
This book? Well <font color="LEVEL">Holly</font>, who is now a grocer in Aden Castle, gave this book to me. And I lost it... for a library director I sure lose a lot of books.. Anyway let me tell you a secret... ready? I don't believe in coincidence. <br>
...That being said, perhaps fate wants you to take this book back to <font color="LEVEL">Holly, the grocer in Aden Castle</font>?
