Tablet of Vision:<br>
Great knowledge rushes into your mind. You hear the sound of distant laughter.<br1>
A voice whispers, "Another Hero is born."<br1>
A lady in blue answers, "No, he's just beginning. I can't give him much power yet, but he conjured the soul himself and filled my brother's vacancy."<br1>
As the power of a king rises, so does the darkness surrounding him.<br1>
A king must know his boundaries as his power can be defeated by shadow or light.<br1>
A tyrant that seeks power above all else may lose his following, yet one who cowers behind the light must call upon people with greater powers than his own.<br1>
Speak with Grand Seer Rahorakti.
