Head Blacksmith Ferris:<br>
What brings you here? Ah, Leikar sent you? The sewing kit she ordered, eh? I was just about to get started on it. I'll just be a moment...<br>
I must have some scraps of steel somewhere around here...<br>
Hmm... I must've used it all up! Hey, I hate to ask you this... But could you get some materials for me?<br>
