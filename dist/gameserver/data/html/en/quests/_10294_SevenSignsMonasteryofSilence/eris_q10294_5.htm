Sister of Silence Eris:<br>
I'm Sorry, but I do not have this book. And I can not check whether you are worthy to read it. The once the book has been divided into parts that were given to the deposit of the guards, elected Solin and Anais. To get the book you need to pass a test at the guards, and the Rangers Treasure. If you want, I can send you to them.<br>
