Abyssal Saintess Elcadia:<br>
I am looking for information about this in the book, we have found in the Library of Runes. And I found just such an inscription: "When will bypass around the monastery, and there will be a path leading to the library, you can find a special device that moves into the cell prioress." So there it is written.<br>
We can only detect this device. We can go to the Monastery of Silence right now. I think Bb easily figure everything out. I'll follow you. As you are ready, go in search of.
