Treasure Guard:<br>
Kaerun not want his memoirs were open to the whole world, because it can lead to unrest. If you really deserve to get his records, you should follow the will of Kaeruna. I'll let you pick up a memoir, if you will extract all four parts, which are guarded by rangers in the north, south, east and west.
