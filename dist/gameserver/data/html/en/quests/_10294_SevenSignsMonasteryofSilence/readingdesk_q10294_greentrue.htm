Within 3 years of wandering in Solina there were thousands of followers. All the while, beside her were her seven students who shared with her all the hardships of the way and took care of her. Here are their names: The High Priest of Anais (He joined Solin, when she was heir to the Emperor.), Strategist and commander Elmoreden Bost, nun Silence Eris, her husband - the famous playwright Kaerun, the famous merchant guild of ethinyl Rudolf van Aegina and his son Judith van Aegina. The latter student almost nothing is known. They say it was called the Black Knight.<br>
