I knew I could entrust you with this mission! Now listen carefully. Kill the Crimson Spiders, no matter how many you find. Collect <font color="LEVEL">Crimson Spider Claws</font> as proof. The <font color="LEVEL">Crimson Spiders</font> have been seen recently in Mimir's Forest, but they also live in other habitats.<br1>
Good luck!
