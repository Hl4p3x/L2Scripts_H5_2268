Secret Agent Collin:<br>
So you've conned a talking frog and an old lady, now comes the real test. I want you to speak to one of the <font color="LEVEL">adult villagers</font> here and get him to hand you one of <font color="LEVEL">their belongings</font>.<br>
Do it and we'll be done with our trainin'. Fail and we'll know more work is needed.<br>
Ready for the transformation?<br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 194 colin_q194_9.htm">"I think so."</a><br>
<font color="LEVEL">(The transformation will cancel all movement-related buffs, including the PC room buff, other than energy buffs.)</font>
