Hierarch Kekropus:<br>
How are the preparations progressing? I see that you are curious about why we are preparing for this ceremony rather than simply leaving for the hunt.<br>
But you have hunted outside before, so you must know that you may meet a foe stronger than you are or be overcome by a poison you have never before encountered. Through this ceremony, we help ensure the safety of those the participants.<br>
The preparations should be complete by now. Go back to <font color="LEVEL">Perwan in the Cave of Souls</font>.
