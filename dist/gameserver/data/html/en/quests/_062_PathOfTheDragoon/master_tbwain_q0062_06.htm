Master Gwain<br>
Excellent! I like your boldness.<br>
The test itself is very simple. You must defeat a certain malignant spirit to prove your bravery and strength and bring back the creature's heart as proof. But no matter how talented you may be, a lack of experience will make you easy prey for this spirit.<br>
Therefore, before you begin the test, I advise you complete some additionl training. Frankly, I am sick of seeing the young of our race die meaningless deaths after taking on this challenge equipped with nothing but courage.<br>
So go to <font color="LEVEL">Gludin Village</font>, train under <font color="LEVEL">Master Shubain</font> and bring back his <font color="LEVEL">letter of recommendation</font>. Then we will discuss the details of the test.
