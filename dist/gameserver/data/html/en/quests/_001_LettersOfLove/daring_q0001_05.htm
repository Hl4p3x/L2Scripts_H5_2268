Darin:<br>
Ah, then you can see why I am so tormented! She is an amazing woman...in fact,  why would a woman like that ever return the love I feel for her? For months, I vowed every day to tell her how I feel, and every day my courage deserted me. What would I do if she rejected me? Now I've written her a <font color="LEVEL">love letter,</font> but I can't bring myself to deliver it.<br>
May I ask a favor? Would you deliver my letter to Roxxy?<br>
