Darin:<br>
Roxxy's handkerchief! Oh, she really likes me! It seems like a dream... Thank you! If not for you, I would never have known..<br>
I must speak with her. So much to do: buy flowers, bathe, get dressed in my finest clothes... Oh, I must hurry! I hate to impose, but would you do me another favor?<br>
Baulro promised that he would brew a magic potion to make me more eloquent. I know how much a woman like Roxxy values intelligence... It wasn't cheap, but I couldn't afford not to buy it. Please take this receipt to <font color="LEVEL">Baulro</font>, and he will give you the potion to bring back to me.
