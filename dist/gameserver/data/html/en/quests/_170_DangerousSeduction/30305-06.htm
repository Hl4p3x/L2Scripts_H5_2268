Tetrarch Vellior:<br>
So you have discovered that <font color="LEVEL">Merkenis</font> has cast a nightmare spell on me using this <font color="LEVEL">nightmare crystal</font>. Well done. Now I can rest peacefully without being haunted by nightmares ... This is all thanks to you! As promised, I will give you your reward.<br>
While you were gone fighting <font color="LEVEL">Merkenis</font>, I found out that the culprit was <font color="LEVEL">Icarus</font>, of the house of <font color="LEVEL">Hardin</font>. So he dares to challenge me, under the protection of <font color="LEVEL">Hardin</font> ...<br>
Long ago, I won a bet against Icarus and obtained a magic scroll dear to him. But he does not acknowledge defeat and troubles me with such petty nightmare spells in order to get his magic scroll back ... Now that I know the culprit, I will not stay silent ...
