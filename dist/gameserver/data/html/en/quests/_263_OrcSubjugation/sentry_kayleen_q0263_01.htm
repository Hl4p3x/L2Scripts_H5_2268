Sentry Kayleen:<br>
I don't know why, but the <font color="LEVEL">Balor Orcs</font>, who had been hiding in the <font color="LEVEL">Misty Mountains</font>, have started to invade our forest in groups. It is unpardonable that the Balor Orcs, who used to be our slaves, have forgotten their place and dare to challenge us!<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">Assassin scouts</font> are following the movements of the <font color="LEVEL">Balor Orcs</font> at this very moment. As soon as accurate information is received, <font color="LEVEL">Tetrarch Vellior</font> will give the command to strike. When the time comes, you should also participate in the battle! We must launch a full-scale attack and drive the <font color="LEVEL">Balor Orcs</font> out of our woods!<br>
(Quest for characters level 8 and above.)
