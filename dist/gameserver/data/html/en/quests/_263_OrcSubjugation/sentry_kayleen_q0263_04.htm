Sentry Kayleen:<br>
Why are your hands so clean when they should be stained with the blood of the <font color="LEVEL">balor orcs</font>? Go quickly into the woods and dispose of the <font color="LEVEL">balor orcs</font>! Go forth in the name of Shilen and take fear as dark as the abyss and death as cold as the deep lakes to those invaders who have violated our land!<br>
You do not want to give up, do you? Do you not hear the <font color="LEVEL">balor orcs</font> on the battlefield outside of the village mocking you? Would you turn and run from their taunts?<br>

<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 263 sentry_kayleen_q0263_06.htm">Say you will quit</a>
