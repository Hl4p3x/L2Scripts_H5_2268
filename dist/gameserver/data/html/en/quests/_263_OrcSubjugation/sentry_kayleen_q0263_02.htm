Sentry Kayleen:<br>
I do not know why, but the <font color="LEVEL">balor orcs</font>, who had been hiding in the <font color="LEVEL">Misty Mountains</font>, have started to invade our forest in groups. It is unpardonable that the balor orcs, who used to be our slaves, have forgotten their place and dare to challenge us!<br>
According to the reports of the assassin scouts, the balor orcs are not simply coming to pillage, but are preparing for a large-scale migration. A sudden invasion of the balor orcs ... Perhaps those cunning <font color="LEVEL">Elves of Light</font> are behind this!<br>
These woods are our home. We have defended ourselves every time the greedy <font color="LEVEL">Humans</font> or the <font color="LEVEL">Elves of Light</font> invaded us. We cannot allow an inferior race like the balor orcs to threaten our woods! All the <font color="LEVEL">Warriors</font> of our race must come together to punish them in the name of <font color="LEVEL">Shilen</font>. Would you like to participate?<br>
