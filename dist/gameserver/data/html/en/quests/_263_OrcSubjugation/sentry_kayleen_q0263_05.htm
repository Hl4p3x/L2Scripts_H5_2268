Sentry Kayleen:<br>
You have fought very well. In the name of <font color="LEVEL">Tetrarch Vellior</font>, I will give you a reward for every <font color="LEVEL">balor orc</font> that you strike down. Those who fight on behalf of the race of darkness will reap a rich reward for their bravery.<br>
But the battle is not over yet. The foreign invaders still lurk in our woods! Will you go back into the battlefield, or will you stop fighting now?<br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 263 sentry_kayleen_q0263_07.htm">Say you will continue</a><br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 263 sentry_kayleen_q0263_06.htm">Say you will quit</a>
