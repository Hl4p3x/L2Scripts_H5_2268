Sentry Kayleen:<br>
Go to the woods and strike down any balor orcs you meet! Someone with your skills can easily take care of the <font color="LEVEL">Balor Orc archers</font>, but the <font color="LEVEL">fighters</font> and <font color="LEVEL">leaders</font> are much stronger than regular <font color="LEVEL">balor orcs</font>, so do not let your guard down!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Tetrarch Vellior</font> made a proclamation just a few days ago. The more <font color="LEVEL">balor orcs</font> that are killed, the greater reward he will give. Slay the <font color="LEVEL">balor orcs</font> and bring back something to serve as proof of your deed. The <font color="LEVEL">archers</font> carry <font color="LEVEL">feather amulets</font>, while the <font color="LEVEL">fighters</font> and <font color="LEVEL">leaders</font> wear a <font color="LEVEL">necklace crafted of bone pieces</font>. If you collect these and bring them to me, I will give you a reward according to the number of items you present.<br>
Excellent! May you go forth in the name of <font color="LEVEL">Shilen</font> and present fear as dark as the abyss and a death as cold as the deep lakes to those invaders who have violated our land!
