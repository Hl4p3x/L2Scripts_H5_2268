Wind Sylph:<br>
Nice to meet you, wise man of the magic world who manages the elements. I am the <font color="LEVEL">Wind Sylph</font>, messenger of Zephyr, guide of the storms. Did you come to me to get the <font color="LEVEL">Tone of Wind</font>, by any chance?<br>
The wind is an inessential figure, which nobody can get hold of... Do you think you can get a note consisting of such wind? Only I can give you the <font color="LEVEL">Tone of Wind</font> So you must make a deal with me.<br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 228 30412-02.htm">Accept the proposal for making a deal.</a>
