Excellent! The <font color="LEVEL">Golden Seeds</font> of the <font color="LEVEL">Singing Flower</font>!<br>
I have experience raising flowers from these seeds. One must be very careful in their cultivation, they can grow into brutal flowers if the seeds taste living human blood. Under normal circumstances they grow into a beautiful flower called 'Millenium Flower.' To grow these you must be able to produce the exquisite 'Absolute Tone'.<br>
The problem is that I cannot produce absolute tone with my skills... Would you be willing to help me once you start your job?<br>
