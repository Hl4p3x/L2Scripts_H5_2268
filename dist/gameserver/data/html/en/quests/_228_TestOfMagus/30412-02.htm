Wind Sylph:<br>
Yes. You are a wise man, indeed. Please find me these things. <font color="LEVEL">20 Harpy Feathers</font>, <font color="LEVEL">10 Wyrm Wingbone</font>, and <font color="LEVEL">10 Windsus Manes</font>... You can get them all from the magic creatures in <font color="LEVEL">Giran</font>.<br>
Do you understand? The harpy which glides with the wind, the wyrm which makes a strong blast while it feathers, and the mane of the windsus blowing in the winds. All these materials are related to the wind, things which I need to control it...
