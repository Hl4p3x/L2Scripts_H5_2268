Bard Rukal:<br>
Mages who command the ultimate elemental magic is like a song from heavens. Unlike other magic, Elemental Magic is used by combining the songs of the spirits.<br>
However not even the element's tone is heard in your ears? Indeed, a symphony of swords and shields or a hymn of prayer and blessings will be easier to hear for you.<br>
(Quest for Wizards, Elven Wizards and Dark Wizards, level 39 or above.)
