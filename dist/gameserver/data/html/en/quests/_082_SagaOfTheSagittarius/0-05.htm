Hunter Guild President Bernard:<br>
Sagittarius's bow, the symbol of our guild, was stolen.<br1>
During the day, it's on display, but at night, I keep it close at hand.<br1>
I was delayed putting it in the safe for just a minute while counting my new coins.<br1>
This must be a conspiracy against me.<br1>
Your reputation is growing, I would appreciate your help.<br>
