Tablet of Vision:<br>
A familiar feeling rushes through your body. And then when it seems unbearable, a new vision appears...<br1>
All the pleasure, pain, anger and love ever felt by all the previous challengers of this power courses at once through your veins!<br1>
The emotions rush over you like a waterfall, and the screams you hear are your own as you slip into unconsciousness...<br1>
<br1>
...<br1>
...<br1>
And then you awake... You mouth moves, but no words are formed...<br1>
Could this be the end?
