Welcome back!  I've been reading the records you gave me and I found something very interesting!<br>
The stories all have something in common. They all met the Lady of the Lake and came across the Star of Destiny.<br>
Is this the Echo Crystal that contains the Forgotten Song? Great job! We can only listen to it once. We can create a musical score if we take this to my friend, Barbado.<br>
Will you continue to help me?<br>
