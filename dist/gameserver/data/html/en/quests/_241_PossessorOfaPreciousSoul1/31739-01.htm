Do you know the story of the seventeen heroes who challenged the Land Dragon Antharas? It's fascinating! Such a heroic sacrifice! It could be an epic poem! In fact, it's one of my all-time favorite stories! It's what motivated me to become a bohemian poet! It's always been my dream to write a great epic poem tying all the pieces of this story together.<br>
Unfortunately, I only know a few fragments of it that I heard from my grandfather. I'm trying to collect everything I can about this story. I'm looking for someone who can help me. Will you do it?<br>
