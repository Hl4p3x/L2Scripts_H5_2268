Astrologer Creta:<br>
A very good idea, I shall do my best....<br>
Let's see, the arms were unusually long, and the head much larger than a human's.<br>
And the tail... It seemed as though the shadow was cast by one far away..<br>
<p>
  Oh yes, one more thing before you go. . Soon you shall meet an ancient one. 
  This meeting will be a part of the test you are taking. . You will return to 
  this place soon.. Until then... Farewell....</p>
