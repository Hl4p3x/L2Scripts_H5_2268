Elder Casian:<br>
So, you have come for the 4th volume of the Scripture of Knowledge? I understand your situation but it is not something that I can give freely. Do you have any idea of the power of these volumes?<br>
They contain the knowledge of the Giants' technology that was thought lost for millenia! The absolute geometry... It's a pity that we can't decipher the texts since we are missing volumes 1, 2, and 3...<br>
