High Priest Sylvain:<br>
You must learn about the purification of light.<br>
As you probably know, my duty is to purify the land of unclean energy. In the eastern part of this village is an execution ground where many of the people involved in the peasant's uprising were killed. This place casts a dark shadow over all of Dion. This evil history has made the area a fertile ground for strange creatures.<br>
You must sooth the angry spirits of the execution ground and assist in the purification  of this land. This won't be easy or quick. It requires patience and persistence. Will you assist me in <font color="LEVEL">purifying the Execution Ground</font>?<br>
