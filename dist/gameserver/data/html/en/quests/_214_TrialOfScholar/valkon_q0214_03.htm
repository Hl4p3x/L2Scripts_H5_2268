Warehouse Keeper Valkon:<br>
So, you will pay the debt? Hey since I loaned that man 1,000 adenas... How long has it been? Let me see... Yes, that was 10 years ago, 10 years! Do you know how much interest is drawn from that? If you compute the compound interest, that would be... Let's say, 100,000 adenas! You will pay all that money for him?<br>
Forget it... I gave up collecting that debt a long time ago. Instead, I have a proposal. If you do me a favor, I shall give you that Scripture of Knowledge.<br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 214 valkon_q0214_04.htm">Accept the proposal</a>
