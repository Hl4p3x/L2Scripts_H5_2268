Magister Mirien:<br>
You have brought the Mark of Cronos! Did you have any problems with him? I must confess, I was somewhat concerned about you. No offense... So, please don't' be angry.<br>
You have completed the Trial of the Scholar! Congratulations! You are approaching a higher level of knowledge and comprehension. I'll additionally give you the <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Scholar</font>! May the Goddess bless you in the future. Goodbye.
