Grand Magister Valdis:<br>
Too bad! I need you to slaughter <font color="LEVEL">Demon's Agent Falston</font> and bring me his Fang!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">As I told you before, you don't have to kill him yourself!</font> There's no rule that says the Clan Leader has to get his hands bloody! Just stand in a safe place an watch your Clan kill Demon's Agent Falston and then bring his Fang to me.<br>
