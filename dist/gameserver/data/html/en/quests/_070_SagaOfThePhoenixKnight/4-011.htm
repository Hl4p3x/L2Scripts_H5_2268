Eric Ramsheart:<br>
Do you remember the oath you took when you first became a knight? To defend honor at all cost? Do you think the actions of Sir Herod, who died a miserable death defending his honor, were right? What did you learn from the testimony of trust?<br1>
Trust is all we knights have to offer!<br1>
Trust also means faith. You don't betray what you have faith in, nor those who have faith in you. There's only one more thing...<br1>
You must discover how to earn trust from people...<br1>
You probably already know all about this. I shouldn't need to explain it to you...<br1>
Now, ask your last question to the stone tablet.
