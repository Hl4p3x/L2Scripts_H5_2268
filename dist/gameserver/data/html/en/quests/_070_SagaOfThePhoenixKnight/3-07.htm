Grand Master Sedrick:<br>
The Orc shaman Tarkai recently gave me instructions on how to activate the Stone of Commune.<br1>
The Ketra Orcs and the Varka Silenos both possess and worship magical fragments called the* Divine Stone of Wisdom*.<br1>
You need one of these fragments to restore power to the Stone of Commune! To get it, you'll have to win their trust.<br1>
Which side will you get it from?<br>

<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_QuestEvent 70 3-7">The Varka Silenos</a>
