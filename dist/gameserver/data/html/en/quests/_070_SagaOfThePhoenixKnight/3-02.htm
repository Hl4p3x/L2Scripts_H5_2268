Grand Master Sedrick:<br>
The advance base of the Ketra Orcs is in the northern part of Goddard Castle Town. Meet with* Ketra's Messenger Wahkan*. You can still change sides.<br1>
Do you remember what a Knight seeks to defend?<br1>
This task is relevant to that! If you fight for one side, you are fighting against the other!
