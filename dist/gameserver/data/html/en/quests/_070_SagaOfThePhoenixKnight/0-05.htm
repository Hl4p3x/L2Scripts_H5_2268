Grand Master Sedrick:<br>
Long ago, a peasant revolt broke out in a small village in Dion Territory. When talks failed, the local manor lord resorted to force. Obeying their orders, the top Knights of the guild fought for him.<br1>
However, many young Knights followed their conscience and sided with the peasants. The order was split, each side feeling righteous.<br1>
 I wonder if either side was right.* Could a Knight just be defending his ego? There is no such thing as true justice.* Whether a Paladin or Dark Avenger, one must choose and defend that choice with conviction!<br1>
Will you take this training journey, as written in the book of ancient rites? Then you'll be able to answer my question!<br>
