Master Felix:<br>
To get the Stone of Commune, you must kill* the Archon of Halisha*, either by entering the Four Sepulchers or by slaying evil monsters in the Shrine of the Loyal by the Wall of Argos.<br1>
Both paths will be difficult!<br1>
The fifth stone tablet is in the northwest corner of the Wall of Argos.
