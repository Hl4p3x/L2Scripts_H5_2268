Tablet of Vision:<br>
As you approach the tablet, you feel a presence. Could it be the soul of the one who discouraged Sedrick and degraded the Fallen Knight Adil, here to prevent anyone from learning the secrets of the tablet?<br1>
It looks back at you with the eyes of* those you chose not to protect*.<br1>
Now the tablet is before your eyes! Is it an illusion?<br1>
The sound of swordplay brings you back to reality.<br>
