Mercenary Red Foot:<br>
Some time ago, I overheard some dwarves talking among themselves in
 a blacksmiths shop  The head of the dwarves perhaps he is called the
first elder?
Anyway, he was desperately looking for a scroll that had hieroglyphic
characters of giants on it.  Although I didnt get to hear the details,
it seemed like some very critical secret regarding the giants scientific
technology was written on it.  I always thought that dwarves were just
busying themselves with their work in blacksmith shops and being
warehouse keepers.  But what do you know  I think they have been working
on secret things while avoiding the scrutiny of humans.<br>
