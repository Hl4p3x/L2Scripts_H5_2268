Mercenary Red Foot:<br>
I will give you the information that a clan leader,
who wants to grow the power of his clan would be
interested in obtaining.  In each area, there are
aristocrats who give support to small clans.  These
aristocrats would include Sir Kristof Rodemai in
Giran Castle Town and Sir Gustaf Athebaldt of
Oren Castle Town.  Of course they are not just philanthropists.
I would say they would want something in return for their
support of a clan, wouldnt you agree?<br>
