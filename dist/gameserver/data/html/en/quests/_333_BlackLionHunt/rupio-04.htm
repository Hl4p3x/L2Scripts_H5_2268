Blacksmith Rupio:<br>
How did you know that my hobby was relic restoration? But with relics
like tablets on which words are written, we can't read them if there
is even one piece missing and so there's really no point in just putting
the other pieces together. In my experience, square-shaped relics like
stone tablets often break into <font color="LEVEL">four pieces</font>.
