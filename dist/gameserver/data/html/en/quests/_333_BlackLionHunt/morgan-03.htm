Guilde Member Morgan:<br>
I really thank you for recovering so many freight boxes like this for us.
If the financial situation of our commercial guild were a bit better, we
would hire competent mercenaries such as yourself as bodyguards... In that
case, the evil creatures would never be able to loot our stuff, no?<br1>
OK! Here, take the gift of gratitude! The amount of the gratitude money
increased greatly after I spoke to my superiors about the hard work you
have been doing for our guild. As this is appropriate acknowledgment for
your hard work, please take it without refusing. And, as always, I present
you with these <font color="LEVEL">coins from our guild.</font><br>
