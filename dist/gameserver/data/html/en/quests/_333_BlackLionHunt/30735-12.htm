Mercenary Sophia:<br>
The Execution Ground is located in the eastern part of the village.
It is an eerie place where people can hear the never ending cries of
 dead souls. Your mission is to clean out the undead that are infesting
the place. According to a rumor, in order to pay for the spilled blood
of innocent people who were killed during the farmers uprising, the
undead came back to this world Well, all I know is that we need to
carry out the given assignment. Still, I dont feel good about this for some reason.<br>
