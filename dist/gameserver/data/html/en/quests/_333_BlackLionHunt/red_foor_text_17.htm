Mercenary Red Foot:<br>
Some time ago, I heard a rumor that there is a society of ancient coin collectors.
At first, I thought that they must be collectors of some anniversary coins that
are not very valuable.  But later, I found out that the value of the coins they
collect is extremely high.  And members of this society are very enthusiastic
about their collection activities that whoever brings some rare coins to them,
they will trade them for some high priced items!  I heard that in order to join
the coin collection society, you have to go see a dwarf called Sorint
at the Hunters Village.<br>
