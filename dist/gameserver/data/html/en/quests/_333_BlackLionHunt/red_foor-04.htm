Mercenary Red Foot:<br>
All right, lets go ahead and open this box  Opening a padlock like this one is a piece of cake  Here we go!  There that was too easy.  Now, lets see whats in the box.<br1>
Whats this pelts?  Dire Wolf Pelts?  They seem to have been tanned by a leather craftman.<br1>
But they are not of high quality.  Maybe they can be used to make leather hats?<br>
