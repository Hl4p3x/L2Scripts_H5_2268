Blacksmith Rupio:<br>
How did you know that my hobby was relic restoration? But to restore a
stone item to its original condition, you can't be missing even one piece.
If you want me to put the statue of the goddess back together, you'll need
all the pieces, which are <font color="LEVEL">head, torso, arms and legs</font>),
right?
