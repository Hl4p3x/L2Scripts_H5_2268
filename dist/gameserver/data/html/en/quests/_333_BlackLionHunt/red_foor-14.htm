Mercenary Red Foot:<br>
All right, lets go ahead and open this box  Opening a padlock like this one  is a piece of cake  Here we go!  There that was too easy.  Now, lets see whats in the box.<br1>
Whats this?  A fragment of a stone statue?  Hmm it looks like a Statue of Shilen, the goddess Isnt she the goddess of death?  For some reason, I dont have a good feeling about this.<br1>
But, if this was not a fragment but the complete statue, it could have fetched a large amount of money  There is someone who can put together a broken relic like this Hes Blacksmith Rupio.<br1>
If you collect all the fragments of the statue and take them to him, he will put them together to restore it and make it complete.<br>
