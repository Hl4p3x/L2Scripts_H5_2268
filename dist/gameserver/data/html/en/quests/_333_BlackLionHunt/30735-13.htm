Mercenary Sophia:<br>
This mission is to drive out the remnants of the Grecian military force that is currently
encamped in the northwestern part of  the Horseshoe Valley.  Dont take them too lightly
by thinking that they are mere rabble of defeated soldiers.    Your opponents are ol mahums
of the Bloody Axe army led by the Blood Lord Nurka.  They are a formidable enemy that you
shouldnt take too lightly.<br>
