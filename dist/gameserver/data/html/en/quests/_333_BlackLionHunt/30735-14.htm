Mercenary Sophia:<br>
The headquarters of delu lizardmen was originally located
at the shore area in the southern part of Giran.  However,
lately, many of them are infiltrating into Dion territory.
We dont know yet whether they are entering Dion just to find
food or to prepare some large scale invasion.  But what is
clear is that they are making their movements with some clear
goal.  Our mission is to smash their units one by one and
instill fear in them thereby discouraging them from settling
down in this area.<br>
