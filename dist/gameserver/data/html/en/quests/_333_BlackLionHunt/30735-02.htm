Mercenary Sophia:<br>
The undead that we need to drive out are <font color="LEVEL">specters, sorrow maiden, neer crawlers, neer ghoul berserker, strains and ghouls</font>.<br1>
I dont know whether you know about this or not.  But whean undead is destroyed, it leaves behind a handful of ashes.<br>
Bring me back that as proof of victory.<br>
The more <font color="LEVEL">ashes of undead </font> you bring, the more rewards you will receive.<br1>
Since you once worked under Captain Leopold, you already know the rule about proofs and rewards, dont you? <br1>
Now then, hurry up.  Prepare yourself for combat and leave for the Execution Ground immediately. Prove to everybody the fact that even the undead who have been resurrected from the dungeon of purgatory will not be a match for us the Black Lion troop!
