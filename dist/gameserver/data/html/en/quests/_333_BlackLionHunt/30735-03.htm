Mercenary Sophia:<br>
The enemies that you will have to defeat are <font color="LEVEL">ol mahum guerillas, ol mahum raiders, ol mahum marksman, ol mahum sergeants and ol mahum captains</font>.<br1>
As a proof that you have defeated the enemy, bring me back the <font color="LEVEL">bloodyaxe insignia</font> the symbol of the partisan army. The more proofs you bring, the greater your reward will be.<br>
Well, since you once worked under Captain Leopold, you already know the rule about proofs and rewards, dont you?<br1>
Now then, hurry up and leave for the Fortress of Resistance. Show them the wrath of the Black Lion troop to those rampaging ol mahums!
