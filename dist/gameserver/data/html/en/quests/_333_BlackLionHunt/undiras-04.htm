Abyssal Celebrant Undrias:<br>
Oh this piece must be?  Although its only part of it still this piece
came from one of the statues of Shilen that were lost!  Where in the
 world did you find it?  Where did you find this sacred object?
This statue is a sacred object for us dark elves.  I will pay you a
great sum of money if you will hand it over to me.  After all, it is
not of much use to you any way,  right?<br>
