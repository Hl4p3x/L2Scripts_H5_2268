All right, lets go ahead and open this box  Opening a padlock like this one is a piece of cake  Here we go!  There that was too easy.  Now, lets see whats in the box.<br1>
Whats this?  Its Spidersilk Rope!  Its a very strong and light rope that is made from the spidersilk that is collected from the Tarantula Spiders webs in the Spine Mountain Range.  If you take it to a store, Im sure you should be able to get a really good price for it.<br1>
