Guard Pinaps:<br>
I carefully inspected the Training Log and Schedule of the Sel Mahums, which you brought it last time. It looks like they are getting trained more systematically than I expected.  I guess just finding out the information isn't enough...<br>
If their power gets stronger through this training, it will be a huge threat to this village. Wouldn't you want to help me to stop their training?<br>
