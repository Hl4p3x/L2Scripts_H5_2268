Head Researcher Sobling:<br>
I don't find anything useful here...
 I'm aware already about some discoveries related to giant's living, but there is no archeological value in vane letters or drawings you may find.
 As i told you, we are in desperate search for <font color="LEVEL">Plans for the construction of Golems, Basis of the Giant's Magic, Construction Technology and Giant's Medical Theory</font>.
 You must bring any of those books complete. Few we can do only with fragments.
