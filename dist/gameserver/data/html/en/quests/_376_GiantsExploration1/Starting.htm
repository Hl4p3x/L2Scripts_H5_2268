Head Researcher Sobling:<br>
Wonderful! Slay the monsters in the <font color="LEVEL">Cave of the Giants</font> and bring back proof that ancient relics are in the cave.<br>
Here is some advice... Although you are clearly an experienced adventurer, it is much too dangerous for you to go alone. You must find fellow adventurers to accompany you. When you bring back proof, I will form an excavation team. I will give you this <font color="LEVEL">Ancient Language Dictionary: Basic Level</font> in exchange for the relics you collect. Please bring back only valuable items.
