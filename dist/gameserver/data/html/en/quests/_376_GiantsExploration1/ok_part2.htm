What is that book? Sobling told you to bring it to me?
 Well... It's written in a very ancient language.. yes.. Humm..
 Take this <font color="LEVEL">Ancient Language Dictionary: Intermediate Level</font> and meet <font color="LEVEL">Sobling</font> again.
 With this he will be able to translate it. Leave now.
