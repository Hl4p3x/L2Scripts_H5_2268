Seer Manakia:<br>
The indomitable Hermodt! The greatest Warrior of the Neruga tribe. If you came here for his remains, listen carefully. It is the story of the great Warrior Hermodt.<br>
Hermodt was the tribe's leader when he set off to conquer the serpent family who invaded their territory. He managed to force the serpents out of the territory.<br>
And chased them to the last one, the Queen Gorgon, so that the snake family would never ever think about invading the Orcs again. However during the chase, he was injured by a poisoned arrow shot by the enemy. But he didn't give up and endured the piercing pain until he finally caught the Queen. At the same time, he himself breathed his last breath because of the poison.<br>
Hermodt, he was a true Warrior indeed, who even stopped death from coming until he had killed the last of the enemy!<br>
