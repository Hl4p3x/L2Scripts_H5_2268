Ah! You mean Commander Kiruna. The only Commander in the Orc Kingdom. She who fell in love with Paladin Gelhaas... The love story of Gelhaas and Kiruna is written in the history of the shrine, and I liked it so much that I read it several times.<br>
Ah! Don't give me that scary look! I bet you Orcs don't like to hear that an Orc fell in love with a Human being. I am so sorry... but, but... Their story... it is so romantic...<br>
