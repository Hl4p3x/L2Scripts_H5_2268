Seer Racoy:<br>
Young shaman, have you come to find the remains of Kiruna? Then first listen! The story of the legendary Warrior, Kiruna the brave!<br>
Once in the past, there was a time when the supreme commander of the national army asked for our support during a tough battle with devil Beleth. So the crack contingent of Urutu with Kiruna as its leader, set off to the battlefields. Kiruna and her soldiers fought bravely against the numerous undead and firmly maintained in the front line, defending againt the evil Black magic.<br>
But when the Death Knight Mordreous showed up in the battlefield, all the soliders got frightened and started to retreat from their lines. How could an Orc Warrior possibly back off! It's all because of Beleth's magic.<br>
However, Kiruna knew no fear. She sang out the hymns of victory and killed hundreds of undead until the last one, the death Knight Mordreous!<br>
