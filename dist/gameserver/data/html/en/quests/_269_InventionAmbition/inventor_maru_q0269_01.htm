Inventor Maru:<br>
Ha ha! You're embarrassed! Yes, you're turning red! No need, no need. My dream is to become a great inventor. For example...just a minute...<br>
(From his bag, takes out a book entitled <font color="LEVEL">"Dwarves: A History of Brilliant Inventions"</font> and begins reading.)<br>
<font color="LEVEL">"During the Age of Empire, "Soren," a great inventor of the Black Anvil Guild, invented the Soulshot in the hope that when the light of the spirits entered a weapon, the Dwarven warrior who wielded it would become even more formidable..."</font><br>
Inspiring, isn't it? One day, I want to be like Soren and have all the history books mention me, too! For that to happen, though, this invention I am working on must be a success...<br>
