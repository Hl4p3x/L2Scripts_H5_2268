Inventor Maru:<br>
Are you still empty-handed? Why haven't you left yet?
 Please hurry to the Eastern Mining Zone and hunt the monsters necessary to acquire the Energy Ore I need for my energy converter device experiments.
 Collect as much ore as you can. I'm counting on you. Together, we can make this invention a success!<br>
