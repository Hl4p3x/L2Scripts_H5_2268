What? Did you say <font color="LEVEL">donation?</font> All that I can think of now is that God damn wolf! Nothing, not to mention donations, can stop me from my revenge.<br>
Fine, if you can help me with my revenge, I will give you as large a donation as you want. Gather <font color="LEVEL">100 pieces of Animal Skin</font> and bring them to me!<br>
(The Animal Skin is an item needed in production.)
