Warehouse Keeper Parman:<br>
I heard this when I was in the <font color="LEVEL">Dion Castle Town</font>. In that village there was a woman who gave birth to 12 children and raised them all by herself. For that reason, she is called <font color="LEVEL">'The great mother'</font>. Isn't it amazing, that a woman could give birth to 12 children and raise them all by herself?<br>
I bet there would be no greater expert than her in <font color="LEVEL">fertility</font>. What do you think? Will you try to go and see her? I don't know her name exactly, though. All I know is that she is called the 'Great mother'. I heard that  <font color="LEVEL">one of her sons is a guard</font> of the village...<br>
