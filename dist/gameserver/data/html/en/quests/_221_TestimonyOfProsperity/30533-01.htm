Elder Balanki:<br>
Pleased to meet you, very pleased indeed. I am Balanki Rollingrock. I am the lead Elder of the renowned Silver Balance Guild. So you are the one that the First Elder has sent to collect overdue guild dues? Let me see... Who has yet not paid...<br>
Hmm... <font color="LEVEL">Trader Mion of the grocery shop</font> has not paid yet. I hear business is good, so why is he not paying his dues?<br>
And another one! <font color="LEVEL">Maryse Redbonnet!</font> I guess revenge is more important to him than guild dues.<br>
Go at once and collect the guild dues from these two!
