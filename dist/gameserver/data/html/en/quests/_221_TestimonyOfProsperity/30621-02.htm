Maestro Nikola:<br>
I devoted my self to investigating the box since I was totally fascinated by it. But the box was locked so tightly that it was impossible to open it in an ordinary way. Breaking it wasn't easy, also.<br>
So I left the box unopened for a while and started to investigate its surroundings. As it is well known, this tower used to be the research center in the age of the Late Giants. But then those ordinary looking stones from the inside of the tower caught my eyes. There were only a few letters on it but it surely was some letters by the Giants.<br>
Ah, before I go on, I have something to reconfirm. You must not tell anyone that I have noticed the letters of the Giants.<br>
