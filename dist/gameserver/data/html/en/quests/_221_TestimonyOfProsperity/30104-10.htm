At last it seems that you are ready to take the second test! Well, the real test begins from now! Until now, the test was only to see if you had the right mind and attitude to become a high rank member.

Recently, we obtained some information on an ancient relic which is thought to be a part of Maphr's Tablet. The investigation team that was exploring the relics of the Cruma Tower have reported that they have discovered a box in which they think that the fragments of Maphr's Tablet are contained. First, take this letter and meet <font color="LEVEL">Maestro Nikola</font>, who is stationed at the <font color="LEVEL">Cruma Tower</font>. He will fill you in on the details.<br>
