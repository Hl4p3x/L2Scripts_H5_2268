Lilith:<br>
What is a Dwarf doing here in a remote island? You came here to see me?<br>
<font color="LEVEL">The Mark of Health</font>? I heard news that my lover who I had been waiting for for a thousand years died a few days ago... Can't you see my grief?... I can't believe that you ask me for some silly mark that you need to pass your test...!<br>
Are all Dwarves like that? How could you say such things to a person in agony... You are so selfish...!<br>
