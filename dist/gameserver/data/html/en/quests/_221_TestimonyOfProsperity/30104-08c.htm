Warehouse Keeper Parman:<br>
Recently, we obtained some information on an ancient relic which is thought to be a part of Maphr's Tablet. Considering that the tablet was made during the era of the Giants, it is very likely that it will be somewhere among the Giants' Ruins. <font color="LEVEL">The investigation team that was exploring the relics of the Cruma Tower has reported that they have discovered a box in which they think that the fragments of Maphr's Tablet are contained.</font><br>
 Your task is to go to the site and collect Maphr's Tablet fragment! It will be a very dangerous task. First go and meet <font color="LEVEL">Maestro Nikola</font>, who is stationed there. You will most likely be able to meet him near the <font color="LEVEL">entrance of the Cruma Tower</font>. He will fill you in on the details.
