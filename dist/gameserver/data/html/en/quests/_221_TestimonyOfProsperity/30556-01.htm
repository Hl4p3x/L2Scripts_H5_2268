Master Toma:<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Donation</font>? Donation? Let me see... Is it already time for another donation? Strange indeed! It seems like only a day has passed since I gave one. Isn't this a trick from that rascal Arin? He used to be a simple blade bat-catcher when I was one of the Elders and now that he became one, he dares to command me? Impudent rascal!<br>
But I can't just say no to your earnestness to come here. OK, I will excuse him this time for you. Take it. Here is my donation. Go and give it to that rascal.
