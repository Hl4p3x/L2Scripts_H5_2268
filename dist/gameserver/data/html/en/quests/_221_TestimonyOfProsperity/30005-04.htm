Warehouse Keeper Wilfred:<br>
An Elf more than 1,000 years old...? Yes, that's right! You mean <font color="LEVEL">Lilith</font>.  Yes, she didn't just live for more than a thousand years, she has been waiting for her lover for over 1,000 years. So that means that she must be well over 1,000 years.<br>
I don't know if that means for an Elf, 1,000 years is not a very long time, or if she loved her lover that much.<br>
You should go and see Lilith for yourself. You can find her in the <font color="LEVEL">temple of this town</font>. She looked quite gloomy these days, how about bringing her this brooch as a present? It might cheer her up since Elves adore pretty ornaments.
