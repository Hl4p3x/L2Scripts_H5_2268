Does the horizon beckon you to explore what lies beyond it?<br1>
You could, you know... The title of Duelist is only awarded to those who venture beyond the horizon. They all paid homage to the tablet and obtained power after achieving true enlightenment. Their wins and losses in battle, as well as their titles, are all meaningless now!<br1>
These days, the tablet is almost forgotten, and the rank of Duelist risks being turned into a popularity contest..<br1>
There is much I could tell you about becoming a Duelist...<br>
