Grand Master Sedrick:<br>
He's watched the games for generations!<br1>
He says that only a* warrior who seeks to venture beyond the horizon* will understand him. If you knew Iron's history, you'd understand...<br1>
But he criticized the Duelists and chose Sword Master Iron as the worst! I couldn't understand!<br1>
See the* Arena Manager at the Coliseum* to find out more. He's the one who's pursuing this issue!<br1>
Take this document about Iron to him. I'm curious to find out what he thinks.
