Grand Magister Valdis:<br>
Just killing won't win you a stone.<br1>
First, you must go to the Varka Silenos stronghold and meet with Naran Ashanuk, their messenger. He'll help you to form an alliance with them.<br1>
You must win their trust by proving yourself in battle.<br1>
Or, if you want, you can approach the Ketra Orcs.
