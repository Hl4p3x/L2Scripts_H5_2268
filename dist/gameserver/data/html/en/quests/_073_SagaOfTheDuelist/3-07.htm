Grand Magister Valdis:<br>
What a surprise! Maybe you are guided by the goddess!<br1>
You wouldn't know of that, would you? So, you're a Duelist?<br1>
Maybe you can meet King Van Halter someday. Alas, he is away so much he may lose his throne soon!<br1>
If you're a pilgrim, get the* Divine Stone of Wisdom* and bring it to me. I heard that the Ketra Orcs and the Varka Silenos of Goddard Territory each have one. Which side will you choose?<br>
