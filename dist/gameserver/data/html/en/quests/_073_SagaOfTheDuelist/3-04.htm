Grand Magister Valdis:<br>
 Have you forgotten what you need to do?<br1>
You shouldn't doubt your abilities!<br1>
Or did you really forget where to go? To help the Ketra Orcs, go to their advance base in the northern part of Goddard Castle Town and meet their messenger Wahkan.<br1>
To help the Varka Silenos, go to their stronghold in the western part of Goddard Castle Town and meet with Naran Ashanuk, their messenger.
