I see you're making the Pilgrimage of the Duelist!<br1>
I've heard that what is written on the stone tablet isn't that important! You should try your best every time you fight. Think of every strike as your last...<br1>
That sort of thinking produces miracles!<br1>
Well, I must be going... Here, take this last Stone of Commune. I don't need it. You can probably put it to good use. Good luck!<br>
