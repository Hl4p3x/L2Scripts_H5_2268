Grand Magister Valdis:<br>
Killing alone won't win you a stone.<br1>
First, go to the Ketra Orcs advance base and meet with Wahkan, Messenger of Ketra. He'll help you form an alliance.<br1>
Fight hard alongside them to win their trust.<br1>
Or you could change your mind and fight for the Varka Silenos, I don't care!
