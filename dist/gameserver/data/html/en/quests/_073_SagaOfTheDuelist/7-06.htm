Tablet of Vision:<br>
Countless thoughts beyond comprehension sear painfully into your brain. You hear the faint whisper of a woman's voice.<br1>
A vision appears of a man, smiling down upon the Stone of Commune! It appears he's in a vast library.<br1>
It's Valdis, Grand Magister of Rune Castle Town Library!
