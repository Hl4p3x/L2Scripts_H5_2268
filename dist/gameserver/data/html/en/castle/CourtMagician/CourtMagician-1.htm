Count Magician:<br>
The Talisman is both magical and mysterious. Once applied to your bracelet, you will be able to see its surprising effect for youself. Before I can give it to you, hower, you must prove to me that you are capable of responsibly wielding such power. Give me <font color="LEVEL">10 Knight's Epauletes</font> and I will provide you the Talisman.<br>
