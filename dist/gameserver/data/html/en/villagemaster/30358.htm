Tetrarch Thifiell:<br>
May Shilen's power shade you from the harshness of the light!<br>
On behalf of the Hierarch, who was sealed by those despicable servants of the light, I represent the senior council that governs the race of darkness. It was I, Tetrarch Thifiell -- chosen by Gran Kain, the father of shadow, and Shilen, the mother of the abyss -- who led our brothers out of their underground exile and recaptured the Forest of Shadow from those moon-faced Elves of light! You, child of Shilen! What is it that you wish to know?<br>
