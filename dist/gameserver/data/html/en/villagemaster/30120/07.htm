If the Prophet is a professional in Supplementary Magic, and the Bishop is an expert in Healing Magic. It is advantageous to fight with others in a party rather than to fight alone. During party play or Siege Battle, the role of a Bishop becomes very important. Even a strong Fighter will not be able to fight his best without the help of a Bishop.<br>
Of course the Bishop has healing skills, reviving the dead and damaging monsters with strong strikes with his/her White Magic.<br>
To be an Bishop, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Pilgrim, the Mark of Trust, and the Mark of the Healer.<br>
