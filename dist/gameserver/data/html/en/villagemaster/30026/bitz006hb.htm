Grand Master Bitz:<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">Human Knight</font> seeks to balance attack and defense, rather than devoting all efforts to a strong attack. Human Knights are known for their spirit of self-sacrifice. With shields and excellent armor, they stand between the monsters and their companions. For your future reference, Human Knights have the opportunity to change to the higher-level professions of <font color="LEVEL">Paladin</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Dark Avenger</font>.<br>
