High Priest Baryl:<br>
How long will the peace in Schuttgart last?<br>
It is not exaggerating much to say that the peace is primarily kept thanks to the freezing weather and rugged terrain. However, the whole area is now infested with bandits. Our peaceful lifestyle is like sweet honey, but unless we take precautions, we may all soon come to taste only bitterness.<br>
In times like this, the strength of warriors and disciples like ourselves is more important than ever.<br>
