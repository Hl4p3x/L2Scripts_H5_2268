Hey!
An occupational change means one with certain abilities and experience gets promoted to a higher-level occupation. 
If you are a Scavenger you may change to a <font color="LEVEL">Bounty Hunter</font>. Any other occupations? There are no more. You have already chosen an occupation collecting materials. There is no other path.<br>
