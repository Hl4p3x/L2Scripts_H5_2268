Change of occupation means one with certain abilities and experience gets promoted to a higher-level occupation. If you are an Artisan you can change to a <font color="LEVEL">Warsmith</font>. Any other occupations? Nope. You have already chosen an occupation that makes things. There is no other path.<br>
