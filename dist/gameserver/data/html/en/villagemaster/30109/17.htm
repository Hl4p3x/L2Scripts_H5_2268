A Treasure Hunter can be said to be a specialized Rogue. That is why the combat style and party play is similar to a Rogue using a dagger. During certain times in a Siege Battle, Treasure Hunters can play the role of an Assassin. When an opponent appears he can instantly increase evasion and movement, enabling himself to follow his opponent to kill.<br>
They have basic skills using the dagger and strengthening their light equipment and risky skills which involve attempts to give great damages in an instant.<br>
To be a Treasure Hunter, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Seeker, the Mark of Trust, and the Mark of the Searcher.<br>
