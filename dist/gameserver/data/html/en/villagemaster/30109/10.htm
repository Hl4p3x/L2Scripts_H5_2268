The basic combat style of a Paladin is similar to a Knight, which is a lower occupation in a party. However, their White Magic has been strengthened. And during Siege Battle, a Paladin can use its strong defense to block a stronghold. They will show their best ability while guarding places like the gates or similar places.<br>
They have basic skills such as increasing their defense, healing ones HP and pulling the enemy's attention so he/she can use his/her strong defense.<br>
To be a Paladin, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of Duty, the Mark of Trust, and the Mark of the Healer.<br>
