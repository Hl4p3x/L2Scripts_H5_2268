Wharf Manager Volker:<br>
Ah, lately the old memories seem to be flooding back. Long ago, you know, this wharf was a beehive of activity! Trade ships of the Kresnik dropped anchor every day, filled to the gunwales with all sorts of wonderful items. Giran to the south -- even Heine -- were nothing by comparison.<br>
But then the war came, and diplomatic relations with the Kresnik were cut off. No longer did the wealth-laden trade ships visit. Today, all we see are small passenger ships. Oh, once in a long while, a foreign vessel carrying a party of adventurers may stop in, but... <br>
Sigh...<br>
Oh, before I forget: I have heard news that a ferry has begun service to Gludin Harbor, which is in the Gludio region of Aden Kingdom. The delays of the initial trial runs are over, and it is now in full operation. Why don't you take a trip?<br>
