Trader Arodin:<br>
Please come in! We've been in business for over 100 years, so you can rest assured that we know what we're doing. In fact, we carry weapons to meet any adventurer's needs, so please take your time and have a look around. Oh, I should tell you that they say undead monsters often appear in the ruins left over from the war with Gracia, so you might consider choosing weapons that would be effective against the undead.<br>
