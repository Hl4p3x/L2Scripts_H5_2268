Hmm... Friend, let me give you a little advice. It's a little difficult to get the Advanced Scroll for Wizards. But I have a reliable source that says they can be found near the Ivory Tower. Who knows? You may get an Advanced Scroll there...if you're lucky. In the meantime, what can I do for you?<br>
