Trader Sandra:<br>
There are so many amazing things in this world! I've never seen them, but I've heard about blazing swords and magic shoes that can make you fly! Do you believe that these things really exist? Have you seen them? We have many amazing accessories here, but those items seem almost unreal... Oh, I'm sorry! I've talked too much. What can I do for you?<br>
