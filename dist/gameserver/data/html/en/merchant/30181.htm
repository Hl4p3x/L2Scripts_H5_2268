Trader Galibredo:<br>
Where did you come from, youngster? What are you looking for?<br>
No, no, I am not talking about goods... I'm curious about how you ended up here...<br>
Oh, never mind. Old habits die hard. You must think me a doddering old fool, eh? Well, you might be right. But everything we sell is in good shapre, at least!<br>
Welcome to Galibredo's Magic Shop. Look around -- perhaps there's something here calling your name...<br>
