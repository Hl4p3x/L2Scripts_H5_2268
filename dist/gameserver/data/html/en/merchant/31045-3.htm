The Sealed Blood Crystal is Antharas's crystallized spilled blood. It has lost the original magic power of Antharas's blood, but if you combine it with Will of Antharas, you can obtain an item with tremendous magic power. If you use it, you can resurrect numerous people simultaneously.<br>
This Sealed Blood Crystal can be obtained by hunting the Emerald Horn, Dust Rider, Bloody Fly, Black Dagger Wing, Shadow Summoner, Spike Slasher, and Muscle Bomber that can be summoned from the Dragon Vortex in Dragon Valley.<br>
