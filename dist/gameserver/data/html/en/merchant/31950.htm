Trader Mailland:<br>
You must have a good eye for quality, since you stopped in here -- mark my words, too many adventurers these days choose accessories based solely on appearance. With that in mind, I'd steer clear of that Human woman's accessory shop if I were you. They say she keeps the good items for herself. That's not the way we do business here!<br>
