Maitre' D Yeti:<br>
You want to know how to use the item you got from me?<br>
Bring some <font color="LEVEL">Hot Spring Nectar</font> to the Yeti, they'll use it on their jackpot to make it grow faster. Otherwise, <font color="LEVEL">Hot Spring Mineral Water</font> will aid the growth of your jackpot, but inhibit the growth of the other's.<br>
If you bring <font color="LEVEL">Hot Spring Dragon Water</font> to the maitre' d, he'll secretly exchange your jackpot with the opposing team's and with <font color="LEVEL">Hot Spring Sulfur</font>, you can put all the others' arenas on debuff.
