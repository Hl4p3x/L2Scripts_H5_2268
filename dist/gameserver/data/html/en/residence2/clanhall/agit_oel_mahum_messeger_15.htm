Ol mahum thieves are amusing little fellows. Shorter than the average Ol Mahum, they are exceptionally lithe. If they think they have the advantage, they will attack a target. But if they feel threatened they will evade direct conflict with the enemy while using a unique method to bind his legs.<br>
