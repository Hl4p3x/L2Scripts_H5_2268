Messenger Yeti:<br>
Pettite~ the transparent and energetic building behind me is <font color="LEVEL">Rainbow Spring</font>. Not my type, but very high class nonetheless. It's a place so nice, it's simply overlooked by ignorant adventurers. The winner gets ultimate bragging rights.<br>
The last winner was <font color="LEVEL">%owner_name%</font>, challenge him if you think you can defeat a clan!<br>
Registration finished at: <font color="LEVEL">%siege_date%</font><br>
