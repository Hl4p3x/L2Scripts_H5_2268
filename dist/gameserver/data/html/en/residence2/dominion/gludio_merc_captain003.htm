Mercenary Captain:<br>
Mobility is a basic skill of all mercenaries. What's really needed in a large-scale battle is striders, of course.<br>
A mercenary company receives striders when it signs a contract with a lord. Then we assigne them to individual mercenaries. If you need one, bring enough badges to prove your skill.<br>
