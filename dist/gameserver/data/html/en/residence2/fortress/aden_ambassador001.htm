Ambassador of Aden:<<br>
My master is the ruler of Aden Castle, renowned throughout the world for his wisdom and strength. To you who have gained possession of this fortress, he sends these words: "Prove your loyalty with this contract!"<br>
Unless you do so, my lord will know that your loyalty is suspect. Make your decision!<br>

<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_no">"I need no help from people like you!"</a>
