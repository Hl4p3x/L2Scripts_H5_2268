The current Guards' defense level is <font color="LEVEL">%guard_buff_level%</font>. If you raise their defense level when the enemy attacks, your P. Atk./P. Def. will be increased, giving you an advantage in battle.<br>
At each level, you may also provide the Guards with weapons and armor. Extension is possible up to 2 levels. Providing high-level weapons/armor requires 100,000 Adena, and providing top-level weapons/armor requires 150,000 Adena.<br>
