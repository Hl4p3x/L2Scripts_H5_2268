Well, since you're here, you must've heard that Rainbow Spring is one of the best places in the world to fish!<br>
This area would be a good place for you to start! The fish are very plump here! I've also heard that <font color="LEVEL">many people have caught Clan Hall War Decrees</font>! If you want to buy or sell anything, just let me know.<br>
