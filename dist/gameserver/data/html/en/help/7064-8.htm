Diary of Lydia: <br><br>
Dark Deeps <br> <br><br>
Starlight reflected in his smile. <br><br>
He speaks of courage, but I do not know where or even who I am! <br><br>
Can crazy people can be courageous? Who knows? <br><br>
His laughter is heard, and again, the word courage.
Other words, but they are in another language, I do not understand. <br><br>
Dark Magician with his smile speaks softly to me, holding my hands in the dark night. <br><br>
Courage.
Courage.
Courage.
Nothing else matters. <br><br>
My ceremony is still ready!
What's going on here so late? <br><br>
