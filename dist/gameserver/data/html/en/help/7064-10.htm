Diary of Lydia: <br><br>
I do not know why I'm here!
I think he knows all my most secret secrets!
He asked me what I do not want to leave.
I was Cesna with him, but I can not remember what I said.
All that was ... I lost it!
Make that really happen?
He requested that I gave all of myself to this!
He accused me of betraying my family, my life, my God, and even the natural law! <br><br>
