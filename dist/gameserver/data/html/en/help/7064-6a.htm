Royal Guide Run'y raslableny for ages, and something had to happen!
Eilhalder brother said that our family should first get on Run'y sewn up, not the royal family! <br><br>
I'm not sure, and I do not believe in all this ... <br><br>
Nidrah came to me this evening.
He soobshil me that no matter what I decided, I should always show their courage during the terrible time.
What did he mean by that?
I have always been brave! <br><br>
