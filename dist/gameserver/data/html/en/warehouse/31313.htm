Warehouse Keeper Lunin:<br>
What I finally realized after 50 years as a warehouse keeper is that wealth really comes and goes. For instance, until last year the van Holter family controlled Rune's commercial rights, but they are now in the hands of the Benandati cartel.<br>
You have to know things like that if you want to run a business in a dangerous town like this one, of course...<br>
