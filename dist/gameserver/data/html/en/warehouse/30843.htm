Warehouse Keeper Romp:<br>
Just because you are near Aden Castle doesn't mean the roads are safe, you know. This area is near the border, which means that you never know what will happen next. That's why our warehouse is so important. If you have things to be delivered, let us take care of them instead of risking trouble by carrying them yourself. Once you deposit your items here, they are safe from thieves, armies, monsters and disasters. Best of all, you can withdraw them at any of our locations!<br>
