Warehouse Keeper Marty:<br>
If you think delivering an item might be dangerous, why don't you use our warehouse? We are Dwarven traders, after all -- experts in the warehouse and banking business across the continent. Use our service and you can deposit or receive your item anywhere!<br>
As you see, our headquarters are here in the Ivory Tower, safely beyond the reach of greedy nobles or ambitious adventurers.<br>
