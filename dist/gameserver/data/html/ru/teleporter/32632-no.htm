Gracia Survivor:<br>
I understand. But Gracia is not a place to be taken lightly. Given your inexperience, even if you go there you would only be a liability to the war effort.<br>
Aden also has many monsters and the need for adventurers to fight them. Build your skills here, then go to Gracia.<br>
(It is recommended that only characters who are level 75 or higher travel to Gracia.)
